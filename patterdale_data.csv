Five Rescues in 48 Hours for Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team,2018-08-12,Grisedale,NY 35300 12800,"A very busy weekend…Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team members were called to five rescues within 48 hours this weekend. The first rescue, on Friday afternoon, was for a man who sustained an open fracture to his leg whilst taking part in an organised mountain bike race. He was treated on scene by team members and then flown to hospital by the Great North Air Ambulance.The second incident was for an 84-year-old man who had fallen whilst walking with family from Howtown to Patterdale. He sustained a head and facial injury and became disorientated and confused following the fall. He was treated by one of the team’s doctors on scene and then taken by the team’s rescue boat for onward transfer to hospital. On Sunday, the team dealt with three further rescues. The first, at around 0830 in the morning, was in response to a 999 call from two young men from London who were wild camping at Hard Tarn. They awoke to find themselves in thick mist and were unsure how to navigate back down to the valley safely. Nine team members went to locate them and then escort them safely off the mountain.Mike Blakey, Mountain Rescue Team Leader said: ‘Once again we’d like to take the opportunity to remind those who are visiting the mountains of the Lake District to check the weather forecast before venturing out. The heavy rain which arrived on Saturday evening, and the associated low cloud, should have been no surprise to anyone venturing onto the fells.’He went on to say: ‘Mountain rescue teams are entirely voluntary and, although team members are always willing to assist those in need, it can be frustrating and tiring when teams are called to those who could have avoided the situation that they found themselves in. This is particularly so when teams are already stretched dealing with more serious incidents.’ As the team completed the first rescue at around 1400 on Sunday they were then called to assist a woman who had fallen and sustained a fractured shoulder whilst walking the Coast to Coast long distance route. Team members, assisted by Penrith Mountain Rescue Team, climbed back up the valley they had just returned from to assist the woman. She was treated on scene and then lowered on a stretcher to the waiting Great North Air Ambulance before she was flown to hospital for treatment.As the second rescue of the day was starting the team were also paged by Cumbria Police to assist a 12-year-old boy who had fallen approximately 20ft from Swirral Edge, Helvellyn. Team members were sent to locate the boy and his father but they had made their own way safely to the valley. The team were out on incidents for approximately 18 hours over the weekend. "
4 Poorly Equipped Walkers Rescued from Dove Crag,2018-08-19,Dove Crag,NY 37300 10429,"At 04:09 on Sunday morning (yes 0409 AM) Patterdale MRT were called by Cumbria Police to respond to a report of four very wet and cold walkers somewhere near to Dove Crag, high in the Lake District. The four walkers, like several others before them, had failed to locate the Priest’s Hole where they had intended to spend the night.The Priest’s Hole has grown in popularity following the BBC’s Secret Britain programme in 2016. Since the programme was aired, Patterdale MRT members have responded to several serious incidents, including a fatal accident at the site. The programme has definitely increased the number of people attempting to spend the night there.The Team’s leader, Mike Blakey, said: ‘The Priest’s Hole is not an easy place to find and it sits high on the face of Dove Crag, an overhanging cliff. The route in and out can be dangerous and the start of the path can be difficult to locate, even for experienced walkers who know the location.’‘I cannot stress strongly enough the importance of understanding and taking note of the weather forecast. Just like last weekend, the unpleasant weather was forecast and therefore wholly predictable. Walkers must make sure they are properly equipped for their adventures and the weather. This means that you need waterproofs when it rains.’‘Although rescue teams are always willing to respond to those in need, people do need to make sure they are well prepared and resilient enough to at least take care of themselves until rescuers arrive. With the right equipment people can often take care of themselves and walk out after sunrise, when things often look better. ’‘When anyone calls for a mountain rescue team a chain of events unfolds from the 999 telephone call onwards. It starts with team members being alerted (by the Police, ambulance or Coastguard) via SMS, email and landline messages from the SARCALL system. One simple call can wake forty team members, as it did at 0400 this morning. From that point on, the rescue team’s duty leader will try to establish contact and work out where the injured or missing person is. In this instance, they were sitting right on the ‘border’ between Langdale MRT and Patterdale MRT. Given the four people were reporting that they were very wet and cold, both rescue teams went to their aid.’‘On this occasion, as the people had a 4G signal, we asked of them to download OS Locate onto their mobile device. Within just a few minutes they were able to provide the team with a grid reference, which turns a potential search into a rescue as team members can go directly to that location.’The four walkers were located safely at around 0715 by team members from Patterdale and Langdale Mountain Rescue Teams. The incident lasted six hours."

2 Males lost close to the summit of Hart Crag,2017-10-14,Hart Crag Summit,NY 36800 11200,"We’ve just had a call out running for the past four hours. A couple of chaps lost in the cloud. Our SARLOC system didn’t work on their phone so we asked the lost people to download OS locate over their 4G connection and within seconds we had a grid reference. Once we had this reference we worked out a compass bearing and asked them to walk on it. This worked and we soon had them walking in the right direction. An hour later we spotted their torch high on the mountain. Three hours later and they were down in the valley safely.Luckily these guys had a map, compass and torch so we were able to help them off the fell.For the record, although this was a joint call out for Patterdale and Langdale MRT, we agreed that we wouldn’t race each other up the mountain to see who could get there first! Likewise, there was no ‘sport’ to be had today and definitely no ‘fisticuffs’.However, we did spend most of the day sorting out the Base after some major building work. We also spent the day at the Lakes Trail event. Tomorrow much of the same. See you there tomorrow if you are running."

Rescue of group of inexperienced walkers from a group of 76,2017-09-16,Scandale Pass ,NY 39211 09712,"Tonight we received a 999 call, via Cumbria Police, to assist a group of walkers who were making slow progress off the mountain. It turns out that the group were actually benighted without torches, having been caught out when it went dark. One had suffered a very minor injury but perhaps they had all bitten off more than they could chew?When we went to meet the original 999 caller, at the pub, we were disappointed to see that he was tucking into his dinner and a glass of red. Rather thoughtless given I'd just left my dinner at home! Another team member had just left his dinner with family, another a wedding and another a party. Now we aren't a rescue team known for criticising but this incident was 100% avoidable, and we didn't hear a thank you..It turns out that the five were part of a group of 76! The leader of the group was safely tucked up back in his accommodation when we called to ask him whether he could account for the other 71! It turns out he couldn't and there were two more walkers missing. Luckily they made it down to a campsite under their own steam whilst confusion continued. Let's hope the others are all safe and we're not going back out.Whilst this rescue was going on our colleagues at Langdale Ambleside MRT took another call. This time for two walkers who were lost in the same area. Both teams initiated a search and eventually the missing people made their own way down to the valley. This group had separated and both pairs were well and truly lost. Neither really knew where they had been and neither could use a map properly.... not that that would have helped as they didn't have one. Neither did they have torches.Please please please take a map, appropriate clothing and a torch if you are going into the mountains. Then we can save our time for helping people who really need our assistance and we might even get to enjoy our dinner, wedding or party!We don't mind helping at all but we'd really like to see more people taking the mountains seriously. We want people to keep themselves safe.However, that said, if you ever feel like you need a rescue team just call 999 and ask for the police and then mountain rescue. We will always come out.It's quarter to one now. You get the idea!"

"‘Find My Friends, the Apple App, helps to save a man’s life in the English Lakes’",2017-07-24,Dove Crag,NY 37603 10897,"Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team Undertake Five Rescues in Less than 24 Hours‘Find My Friends, the Apple App, helps to save a man’s life in the English Lakes’Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team, in the Lake District National Park, undertook five rescues between 1500 on Sunday and 1500 Monday afternoon.The first rescue on Sunday afternoon involved a woman from the Stockport area who had suffered a knee injury on Place Fell. She was treated on scene and stretched to the valley bottom. The woman and her partner had quite rightly planned a walk so that they would get off the mountain before the forecasted heavy rain and cloud arrived from the North, but the injury slowed them down and unfortunately the first rescue was undertaken as the weather front passed through. As we were placing the woman into one of our four Land Rover Ambulances the team were alerted by the Police to two young walkers who had become stuck on a narrow ledge on a difficult section of Striding Edge on Helvellyn. This rescue was finally completed late on Sunday evening and team members returned home wet and tired in the dark.Mike Rippon picks up the story from Monday: ‘At around 0900 we received an emergency call from Cumbria Police reporting that a young walker had fallen and suffered a head injury on Hart Crag. The Team Leader kept contacted the man and made an effort to attempt to identify where he had fallen so that the assembling Team could go to his aid.’Mike Blakey, Team Leader continues: ‘Luckily this young man had a good mobile data signal. Usually, this would mean that we could send a text message which would allow us to locate him on our mapping systems.  Unfortunately this didn’t work due to incorrect settings on the man’s mobile phone. Whilst team members arrived at the rescue base and then began ascending the mountain, I continued to attempt to work out the man’s location by speaking to him on the phone. It became apparent that he had no idea where he was as he had spent the night on the mountain having failed to locate the Priest Hole cave where he had planned to stay the evening before. He had set off in the forecast heavy rain and cloud and having spent the night in thick cloud he began to descend the wrong way in the morning and the fell into the top of a steep gully well above the cave.’‘The man had given the name of a nearby hill, Hart Crag, in his first 999 call but this didn’t stack up with the description of the area he was describing on the phone. As the young man was unable to provide an accurate location, I asked him to allow me to use ‘find my friends’ on the Apple iPhone. This allowed me to see his location on a satellite image on my iPad and we were then able to work out a grid reference to send the team and two helicopters which were on route. As I was at my desk it was then over to the Team members on the ground to continue the rescue and for me to reassure the young man that help was on the way. He was clearly very scared and ups"

The man had reportedly drunk a large volume of alcohol and had not been seen by his friends or family since 0100.’‘The area is notoriously complex with several hazards, including old mine workings and fast flowing deep water. We immediately sent a search dog to the area whilst the rest of the team were mobilising. Given the information available we also called for the assistance of five other mountain rescue search dogs, Penrith MRT, and Keswick MRT to provide a group of swift water technicians to help us to search the gorge and river.''At around 0500 the Team’s search dog, Corrie, and handler, Andy, located the missing male who had fallen down a wall about 10ft high and then somehow fallen another 8 to 10 ft into the old waterwheel housing. When the handler got to him he was sleeping off the alcohol having sustained suspected spinal injuries in his fall. Given the large volume of alcohol he said he had consumed it was difficult for the team to fully assess the extent of his injuries.’‘The remaining team members went to the man’s aid and undertook a complex rescue to evacuate him, firstly from the Waterwheel housing and then up a grassy slope. He was then lifted, horizontally, on the stretcher up the 10ft high wall.'‘This call-out came in the middle of the night, disturbing the sleep of the team members who are all volunteers and give their time freely. Indeed, many members were about to spend the day at the Lowther Show to help raise funds for the Team. It is disheartening to report that the man was abusive to team members, paramedics and the Coastguard helicopter crew that flew him, in poor weather conditions to James Cook Hospital, Middlesbrough.’‘The man was released from hospital the next day with some minor spinal injuries and I expect a pretty serious hangover.’The search and subsequent rescue lasted five hours and involved two mountain rescue teams and six Lake District Mountain Rescue Search Dogs, the Police, Ambulance Service and HM Coastguard helicopter.Mike finished by saying: ‘It’s a good job he doesn’t have to pay for any of the rescue services, because the bill would probably be quite expensive! We wish him a speedy recovery.'"

Unfortunately with the light failing and the gullies and crags in thick mist the search had to be called off until the following morning. At first light the four team members re-ascended the steep slopes of St Sunday Crag with the shepherd and made their way under the crags until the dog was sighted high up in East Chockstone Gulley. Technical climbing gear was used to ascend the steep gulley which was full of loose wet rock. Once they made the ledge another rope system was used to descend back down the gulley. 'Kim' and the shepherd were then re-united after a long wet night!"

Man dies on Helvellyn after suffering chest pains,2015-10-24,Swirral Edge,NY 34210 15344,"Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team’s busiest every year.Every time Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team undertakes a rescue we publish a press release explaining the facts about what happened and how we responded.However today wasn’t a typical day. Firstly, a man tragically died on Helvellyn. He was the sixth person to die on the mountain this year – all in unrelated incidents and with no common theme. Sadly, the 52-year-old man from Yorkshire suffered a suspected cardiac arrest. The team knows all too well how difficult this is for all concerned and the thoughts of all team members are with the the man’s family and friends.The day started at about 0830 for the team. It was the team’s annual open day and team members were preparing the base. Tidying up, moving vehicles and trailers, and beginning to set out cakes for the pending visitors later in the day. We were aiming to welcome previous casualties and supporters and raise awareness of our need for new radios and additional funding. At about 1030, just before the base was due to be opened to the public, the team received a pager message from Cumbria Police. A few minutes earlier the police had received a broken 999 call from a man reporting that his father-in-law was suffering from chest pains on Helvellyn.At this point the preparation for the open day stopped. The team members who were sweeping up and preparing the base quickly began to pull on waterproof clothing and get their kit together to deploy to the mountain. Two Landrover Defender ambulances left base a few minutes later with ten rescuers on board and full medical kit.The team leader explains: ‘When a 999 call is received we do everything we can to gather as much useful information as possible as the team deploys. Often the Police have done this really well for us but the 999 call dropped out initially. In this instance, all we knew was that the casualty was seriously ill and on Helvellyn and a few minutes later we heard that CPR was in process. We didn’t have an accurate location from the 999 call and so attempted to call the informant’s mobile phone. The nature of the mountain terrain means that this isn’t always possible and this was one of those instances. With the absence of hard facts, we left base with blue lights and sirens and headed as far as we could into the mountains. ‘At the time of the 999 call the Team requested two helicopters. One, the air ambulance, because of its rapid response and medical staff and the other, a Coastguard helicopter from Wales, because of its extended capability including the ability to winch.’‘Whilst the team were on route we managed to ‘fix’ the 999 caller’s mobile phone which gave us an accurate location of the incident. This was high up Swirral Edge and in cloud.’‘The team made their way on foot from Brown Cove climbing up onto Swirral Edge, arriving about an hour after the initial call. The air ambulance paramedic and doctor arrived a few minutes ahead of the team"

An RAF SeaKing Helicopter, which was already on route to the Lake District from Northumberland for training, was immediately requested by the Team and provided invaluable support throughout.Initially, the SeaKing helicopter flew three team members and the air ambulance paramedic and doctor as high as possible on the mountain, limited only by low cloud and poor visibility. The helicopter, by this time low on fuel, returned to collect additional team members and a second doctor, and flew these to the same location. From there, the team made their way on foot up on to Striding Edge and down towards the casualty site whilst the helicopter returned to refuel.Once arriving on scene the team took over from the man's son and passers by who had climbed down the mountain and had been carrying out CPR. The team's doctor assessed the man and sadly he was pronounced dead on scene having sustained severe head injuries.Mike Blakey, Patterdale Team Leader said: 'On behalf of the rescue services involved in the incident today, we would like to express our sincerest condolences to the family and friends of the man who tragically lost his life. Helvellyn is a very special place and the ridges make for a great mountain day. The man and his son were well equipped. Those people who were walking on the ridge at the time, and who risked their own safety to assist the man, should be commended. They did everything they could to help.''The RAF SeaKing helicopter from Boulmer, which assisted us today, will go out of service later this year. I would like to thank the SeaKing crew for their support over the years and in particular today. Today's accident occurred in low cloud and the SeaKing crew did everything they could to get rescue members as near as possible and ensure that the man and his son were flown off the mountain as quickly as possible. Our thanks also go to the Great North Air Ambulance and Penrith Mountain Rescue Team for their assistance. In total there were approximately 30 rescue team members involved for five hours.'The team would like to remind anyone who requires assistance in the mountains to call 999 and ask for the Police and Mountain Rescue."

Man survives 200 metre fall from Helvellyn and team evacuates 40 people from Kirkstone Pass,2015-02-22,Brown Cove,NY 34600 16500,"Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team were nearing the end of a winter training exercise on Sunday morning when a 28 year old man stumbled out of the white-out conditions and collapsed at their feet. The man, who it later transpired had fallen about 200 metres from Swirral Edge on Helvellyn, was initially unable to tell the rescue team what had happened or whether he was alone. He was assessed and quickly transferred by stretcher to one of the Team’s vehicles, which was parked nearby at Brown Cove dam. The man was then taken by Landrover Ambulance, which was fitted with snow chains, to Patterdale MRT’s base where he was assessed and later released. Remarkably the man had only suffered minor injuries.Mike Blakey, Team Leader, said: ‘This was one lucky chap. Not only did he fall a long way from a mountain on which three people have died so far this year, but he managed to make his own way down in a snow storm. He had no idea where he had ended up. He described falling through the snow when he was on the ridge and coming to rest about half way down the mountain, still in a blizzard. We had originally planned to train in Red Tarn in the morning, but with the severe weather forecast we changed our plans at the last minute. Five team members went to Red Tarn to attempt to find and recover some of the climber’s equipment from the rescue on Tuesday night last week. The rest of the team went to Brown Cove. If we hadn’t changed our plans this man would not have been rescued so quickly, and it would be difficult to say if he would have found help. He probably should buy a lottery ticket!’At the time of the incident, the Team had just received a call-out from Cumbria Police to assist with a major road accident on the Kirkstone Pass. After evacuating the man who had fallen from Helvellyn, fifteen team members went to assist at this incident, and were joined by Penrith Mountain Rescue Team.

I think we’ll need a bigger freezer, if 2015 keeps up at this rate.’ The team is currently fundraising to replace their current radios which are tired and starting to fail.

Together the teams searched the group’s intended route from the point where they were last seen at around 1500 on Saturday afternoon.Mike Blakey, Team Leader explained: ‘Once we had met with another member of the walking group it was clear that the group had intended to cross underneath Dove Crag before climbing to Hartsop Above How and descending to the valley. Although the group were very experienced, it was unusual for them not to have notified anyone of the their safe return. ‘‘We quickly managed to find their cars and LAMRT tried to fix their phones using the SARLOC system. Given that we couldn’t contact the missing people by phone and the weather was deteriorating we decided to search all of the major routes to the North and North East of Dove Crag and the crags below. At around 2250 the four people were happily found by a search dog handler on route to begin her search area. The four were uninjured but tired and they were transported back to base for tea and rewarming. Two of the group were mildly hypothermic.’‘It transpired that the group had initially got lost below Dove Crag and then eventually managed to find the main path down Hartsop Above How. However, two of the group had become cold and tired and their descent was therefore very slow in low cloud, darkness and high winds. At one point two of the group were blown over.’‘We’re all very happy that this group of experienced walkers managed to get themselves out of trouble and off the mountain unharmed.’The rescue involved approximately 45 rescue team members from four rescue teams and lasted over five hours.

Dog Survives the Night in Severe Weather on the Mountain,2014-02-02,Caudale Head,NY 41377 10316,"On Saturday 1st February, at about 1445, a worried solo male walker from Warrington, Cheshire, walked into the Brother’s Water Inn near Hartsop.  He had lost his dog in a snowstorm and wanted to call the Police to alert mountain rescue. Patterdale mountain rescue team members were immediately called and a small group went to the man’s assistance. On arrival, it transpired that the man had walked up to Caudale Head, but found himself in whiteout conditions on the summit. He decided to take a compass bearing to take him North and back to the safety of the bunkhouse where he was staying. However, whilst walking on the bearing the man slipped and fell approximately 150 metres down a very steep snow covered mountainside. Whilst he was falling uncontrollably he lost his dog, crampon and both walking poles. Unbelievably, the man survived the fall with only cuts, bruises and a sore shoulder. He made a concerted effort to climb back up and find his dog but rightly turned back when the terrain became too difficult.With darkness falling, and the severe weather set to stay overnight, Patterdale mountain rescue team took the difficult decision to wait for the weather to subside on Sunday morning before starting a search for Bonnie, the missing dog. Given the heavy snow on Friday and storm on Saturday, the team went prepared to search avalanche prone terrain. Five members of the team and the man climbed for an hour and half to reach the corrie and then formed a line to search the area. When they arrived there was no sign of the missing dog, a large area to search and lots of snow, which in some places was waist deep. With snow shovels, probes, avalanche transceivers and ice axes the team set about their task. After an hour of searching (and slipping and falling) the team spotted a dog sitting on a small rocky outcrop. Minutes later they found a broken walking pole, a crampon and eventually another pole. The line that the man had fallen down the day before was clearly evident. He was indeed very lucky to have escaped relatively unscathed.Amazingly, the dog had survived the night, and with a bacon sandwich inside her and some dog treats she was able to walk down the steep mountainside to be reunited with her master. They were both extremely pleased to see each other and quietly recognised how lucky they had both been. The team walked off the mountain and everyone went for a well earned pint of ale in the local pub.Patterdale mountain rescue team would like to remind those venturing into the fells that full on winter conditions exits on many high fell tops.

The girl was part of a group of six teenagers who were undertaking a four-day expedition and passing through the upper Grizedale valley near Patterdale.Mike Blakey, Team Leader said: ‘the police received a 999 call shortly before 1300 from a passing walker who came across the group of teenagers. We were unable to call the informant back to get an update on the casualty’s condition or location because the original call had been received as a roaming emergency call.’‘The team had just finished training in worsening weather conditions when the call came through for assistance. Given the nature of the incident we immediately requested assistance from the Great North Air Ambulance. However the winds were too strong for the helicopter and it was forced to turn back. We therefore requested assistance from the Air Rescue Coordination Centre, in Kinloss, and a Sea King helicopter (Rescue 122) from RAF Valley in Anglesey was mobilised.’‘Given the nature of the incident we called for the assistance of Penrith Mountain Rescue Team and five members of the Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service who made their way on foot with Patterdale Team members to the scene of the incident.’‘An hour after the initial call the first rescue team members arrived on scene and assessed the girl. 50 minutes later Rescue 122 airlifted the girl and another from the group who was mildly hypothermic. Both were flown directly to hospital in Barrow in Furness and were discharged later in the evening. The helicopter was operating at its limit in the extremely strong gusting winds and the aircrew demonstrated their exceptional skill in assisting with the rapid evacuation of the girls.’ ‘During the rescue several team members described extremely strong gusts of wind which physically picked them up and threw them to the ground. One Patterdale team member suffered chest injuries. A second teenager from the original group was blown over and suffered minor head injuries. Both were assessed by the Team’s doctor.’‘Whilst the rescue teams were descending to the valley they came across a second organised group of six teenage girls and leader who requested our assistance. All ten teenagers were taken back to our rescue base and given dry clothing, warm drinks and blankets.’‘Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team cannot stress enough the importance of checking weather forecasts before venturing into the mountains. Routes should be amended based on the information available and conditions on the ground. In this instance the weather forecasts had been clear about the strength of the wind and the heavy rain forecast and so this incident, and subsequent injuries to team members may well have been avoidable.’‘We would like to thank Penrith Mountain Rescue Team, the Royal Air Force and the Great North Air Ambul"
