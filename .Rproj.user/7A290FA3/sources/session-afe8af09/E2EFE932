To ensure the injured walker wasn't still in the area reported, several team\\nmembers made their way in a team vehicle to the reported location. After a quick\\nsearch in the immediate area, it was clear there was no one needing our\\nassistance. The team were stood down shortly after.\",      \"Incident 124 - Sunday 23rd October 2022 20:39hrs.  On Sunday evening the team had been made aware of a missing person from the\\nBamford area.
