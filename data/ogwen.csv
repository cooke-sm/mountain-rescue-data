Tal y Fan,2008-01-31,03:00,1,"The casualty was walking with friends on Tal y Fan with friends when she slipped on ice and injured her ankle. The Team were activated, with several Team members going directly to the location and arriving on scene very quickly, whilst the Team vehicle was brought round with extra equipment. It was decided that a helicopter evacuation would be in the best interests of the casualty but 22 Sqn were already operational in South Snowdonia. Therefore Helimed was requested. The casualty was carried a short distance to the helicopter and then flown to Ysbyty Gwynedd for treatment.",76
Heather Terrace,2008-01-29,01:45,1,"This well equipped couple had descended about half way down the Heather Terrace and then chosen to descend a small gully to reach the lower path in Cwm Tryfan. Unfortunately, the casualty slipped and tumbled about 10 feet striking her head on a rock on the way. She sustained a laceration to the scalp and a possible momentary loss of consciousness. When the Team were called the decision was made to request 22 Squadron as it would be dark before the Team could reach the casualty and the temperature was dropping below freezing. Luckily the heli was already in the air, so they did a quick snatch of the casualty and her companion dropping him at Oggie Base and taking her to hospital.",75
Hafna Mine,2008-01-28,04:00,1,"The Team were called to Hafna Mine to search for a dog that had entered one of the mine workings through a drainage pipe, and had not returned. The horizontal mine shaft was flooded so 3 Team members were kitted out in drysuits before entering the mine workings. An extensive search was carried out but no sign of the dog was found. The following day the dog’s body was recovered from the water near the entrance, where it had presumably drowned very soon after entering the mine.",74
Y Garn,2008-01-18,00:45,2,A party of 2 left Ogwen at about midday to climb Y Garn. They were due to be picked up at 4pm but had not arrived when the informant phoned for help at 5:30pm. The Team were already in the area attending another incident so several troops were diverted to look for the missing pair. Luckily they turned up safe and well at the car park shortly afterwards.,73
Llyn y Cwn area,2008-01-18,04:00,1,"The casualty arrived at the top of the Devil’s Kitchen as darkness fell. He had no torch and was not able to locate the path, but he did have a GPS to tell us where he was! As he could see Llyn y Cwn he was told to make his way there and to wait for Team members to arrive. However, e failed to do this. He left his rucksack under a boulder then went walkabouts. Not surprisingly he couldn’t find the boulder again! Therefore the Team had to locate both him and his rucksack before escorting him off the hill. Poor preparation and lack of equipment contributed to this unnecessary call-out.",72
Tal y Fan,2008-01-07,01:00,1,"The Team were asked to assist a casualty, on Tal y Fan, who had been having chest pain for more than 20 mins. He had self administered his GTN spray four times as he was known to suffer from angina, but this gave no relief so his party asked for help. 22 squadron were also tasked and arrived on scene at the same time as a member of OVMRO. The casualty was given morphine and oxygen and rapidly evacuated to Ysbyty Gwynedd, where a myocardial infarction was diagnosed.",71
North Gully Tryfan,2008-01-07,00:30,1,"The casualty had left the Milestone lay-by at 06:35am intending to walk the North Ridge of Tryfan and the Glyderau. Because of the icy conditions underfoot he diverted on to the Eastern Traverse as he had taken this route before. As he crossed North Gully and moved on to steeper ground he became anxious about the snow conditions and felt unable to move forward or backwards. Unusually there were no other climbers within shouting distance so he dialled 999. Luckily, 22 Squadron were already training in the mountains and snatched the man from his precarious perch. He was deposited at Base for a warm up",70
Devil's Kitchen,2008-01-06,03:10,2,"A group of 4 friends set off from Idwal carpark at about midday intending to walk over the Gylderau range. For some unknown reason they walked up to Idwal, ascended by the side of the Gribin Facet and then headed back towards Bochlwyd. At this point, 2 of the group went back to the car whilst the other 2 continued their walk. They went to Bwlch Tryfan, Llyn Caseg Ffraith, Glyder Fach, Glyder Fawr and started to descend towards the Devil Kitchen as darkness fell. Their progress slowed considerably on the icy path and, although they had torches, they felt it was too dangerous to continue. After several text messages to their friend they sent a text saying ‘Send Mountain Rescue!’ A small party was dispatched from Base to escort the pair of the mountain. Another case of poor planning, a late start and lack of awareness of weather conditions.",69
Capel Curig to Llyn  Crafnant,2008-01-29,02:15,1,"A party of three were planning on a long day out in the mountains, in beautiful weather, when unfortunately the casualty slipped on ice on the footpath only 20 minutes from setting out. She sustained an ankle injury and was unable to walk, so assistance was requested from the Team. As 22 squadron were training in the mountains they were also asked to assist. Although 22 squadron were first on scene, Oggie troops continued to the casualty site to assist the evacuation. The heli was almost called away before lifting the casualty which highlights the need for a ground party to be available. Luckily for her, the second job was cancelled and she was flown to Ysbyty Gwynedd for treatment.",68
Aber Area,2008-01-21,04:45,1,"Towards the end of a walk around the Aber area, the casualty was descending steep grassy terrain when she slipped and injured her ankle. Due to the location of the incident, one of her party had to walk back uphill for about 30 minutes before he was able to get a phone signal and request assistance. Team members rapidly made their way to Aber and to the casualty site just as darkness fell. The Cas Carers on scene decided that the injury warranted a request for 22 Sqn to assist, and the casualty was then packaged for a heli evacuation to hospital in deteriorating weather. If the precise location had been given on the original 999 call, the Team would possibly have taken a Landrover to the top of Afon Gam for a speedier evacuation.",67
Cwm Idwal,2008-01-15,00:35,1,"A SNP Warden contacted Oggie Base with the information that a female had slipped on the path to Cwm Idwal and banged her head. Another SNP Warden went to her location to provide first aid assistance, and then she was able to walk off with him. The rest of her group then transported her to Ysbyty Gwynedd for treatment. OVMRO were asked to be on stand-by in case assistance was required.",66
Penmachno Bridge,2008-01-09,02:25,1,The casualty was found by Team Members to be secured by a throw line above the fast flowing river but some 15m away from the top with vertical rock stopping further movement. He had split away from the Imperial College group and was portaging his canoe around an obstacle some 1km upstream when he lost his canoe and so he jumped into the river to try to retrieve it. He was not able to regain the canoe and so he ended up wild swimming. Eventually he recognised the critical exit and so managed to get to the river-left side on the rock past the [Penmachno] bridge. He tried unsuccessfully to move up the rocks and was secured by other canoeists using throw lines. The Team were called and extracted him using a lower/raise technique. He was very fortunate to come out that adventure alive given the serious nature of the river.,65
Goat path area,2008-01-01,01:50,2,"The informant heard what appeared to be shouts for help from 2 persons in the vicinity of the upper part of the Goat Path. A small party were despatched to investigate. Once the people had been located it became apparent that they had been shouting greetings to other people they saw on the mountain, possibly an acceptable practice in their own country. No further information could be gained as the language barrier came in to play once they realised their actions had caused the emergency services to be alerted!",64
Miners Track,2008-01-27,03:45,3,"The family left the YHA at Idwal late morning for a walk over the Glyderau via the Devil’s Kitchen. They made slow progress through the boulders on the Glyderau and realised the light was fading. They managed to reach the Miners Track but then they were unable to make safe progress due to the darkness, and the fact they had only one small torch between them. They had tried to request help earlier but had no phone signal. A small party of Team members located the family and escorted them back to Base to warm up.",63
Cwn Eigiau Area,2008-01-27,03:30,NA,"A member of the public rang 999 to report apparent distress signal whistles coming from the Craig yr Ysfa area at the head of Cwm Eigiau. Two hill parties set out to investigate, one from Llugwy and one from the Eigiau dam. When they met up by the mines in Cwm Eigiau, with no signs of anyone in distress, it was decided to end the search unless any further reports were received.",62
Forest above Glyn Farm,2008-01-25,01:15,1,"This well organised D of E group were on their 3rd day of an expedition in very poor weather conditions. They were all very wet and cold walking through the forest above Glyn Farm, Capel Curig, when one member apparently felt faint and then collapsed. The group took appropriate action by sheltering the casualty and calling for help at the nearby farm. Team members who were already at Base immediately attended the incident as the casualty had been described as unconscious. They treated the casualty until the ambulance arrived to transport him to Ysbyty Gwynedd. The remainder of the group were taken to Oggie Base to dry out and meet up with their supervisors.",61
Heather Terrace Area,2008-01-24,01:15,1,"The casualty had started to descend Tryfan, lost the route and became stuck somewhere above the Heather Terrace area. Team members were just preparing to go on the hill when he called to say that some walkers were now helping him down.",60
North Ridge Tryfan,2008-01-18,03:00,1,"A group of five experienced friends were ascending the North Ridge of Tryfan when, a short distance before the summit, the casualty slipped on a wet rock, put his hand out and unfortunately dislocated his shoulder. 22 Sqn were already training in the area so were asked to assist. The flying conditions (low cloud) were not suitable for the winchman to be put down at the cas site, so six MRT members were flown to two separate locations and climbed up to the Cas site. One member, who was a doctor, reduced the dislocation which improved the casualty’s pain considerably. He was then able to walk to the road without assistance. He was advised to attend his local hospital for a check-up.",59
Tryfan East Face,2008-01-11,07:30,6,"This group left the road at 10:30hrs and ascended the North Ridge, however the ascent took at least 6 hours due to one of the group being very slow. They arrived at the summit with just 45 minutes before darkness. After starting the descent, they “lost” the North Ridge and decided that going down a steep gully would lead to safety. Inevitably, they became stuck and unable to move up or down the steep, wet gully. They were extracted with some difficulty in challenging conditions by MR parties who had to climb up gullies at night to locate the stuck people. This extrication was compounded by the slow member of that party taking an inordinate amount of time to be brought off the mountain to Oggie Base. The key issues were poor party management, total lack of thought about timing of a trip into the hills and also the risks of descending into a steep gully.",58
Aber Falls,2008-01-11,04:25,1,"The casualty decided to circumnavigate the waterfalls at Abergwyngregn. However, cutting the route short put him on steep wooded slopes. He slipped and fell whilst crossing one of these slopes, sustaining a dislocated right shoulder. Distance of the fall could not be ascertained, however he stated that it was quite a way. The ambulance service was called first. When they arrived on scene it was immediately clear that they could not reach the casualty, so they requested assistance from OVMRO. Team members climbed up steep, wet ground to the ledge where he had landed and then lowered him in a stretcher to the path. He was then able to walk to the waiting ambulance.",57
Moel Siabod,2008-01-08,01:45,2,"It would seem that the male had been out walking on Moel Siabod during the day, and had met up with the female at some point. She was struggling to find her way down so he stayed with her to help her. This delayed him somewhat and night fell before they were off the mountain. He was reported missing by a concerned B&B owner, and the Team were activated to search for him. Whilst the Team were searching he rang the Police to ask for help as they were now lost in the forest above Plas y Brenin. The Team quickly located the pair, after hearing their whistles, and escorted them off the mountain.",56
Tryfan North Ridge,2008-01-29,04:20,1,"A couple were climbing the North Ridge and had just reached the area where scrambling becomes necessary, at the start of the Eastern Traverse. The casualty scrambled up a few ledges but then unfortunately slipped on wet rock resulting in a sliding, near vertical, fall about 20ft down the rock. Luckily, she had no other injuries except a badly deformed broken ankle. As weather conditions were marginal for flying, a hasty ground party were sent out to stabilise and treat her for pain. A short time later 22 squadron were able to deploy 2 MRT parties close to the cas site. A combined effort soon had the casualty stretchered to a suitable winching site and evacuated to Ysbyty Gwynedd by helicopter.",55
Tryfan East Face,2008-01-27,01:36,1,"The casualty and his father were climbing the fifth pitch of Grooved Arete approching ""The Haven"" when the boy strayed onto steep choss when he fell about 10m loosing his helmet just before he stopped and ripping a piece of gear. The helmet landed on Heather Terrace. A group also following the route helped them down to Heather Terrace. The team were called and passersby assisted at the site. Given the onset of darkness and the age of the casualty, 22 Sqdn were requested to assist. Father and son were winched from the site and were taken to Oggi Base where he was examined by a team member (surgeon) who diagnosed a fractured left ankle.",54
Bristly Ridge,2008-01-27,02:00,1,"Whilst ascending the gulley on Bristly Ridge, a party ahead of the casualty knocked down a rock which hit him in the face and he lost is hold tumbling about 8m dislocating his shoulder. The higher party asked if anyone was hurt, people replied yes, and this party then left the area! The casualty was able to start walking off and was met by Team Members and assisted off the hill to Idwal car park. During this descent, his shoulder replaced itself.",53
Trefriw,2008-01-24,05:00,1,"OVMRO were asked by NWP to assist in recovering a body from a riverbank. After the CSI unit had completed their investigation, Team members carried the body to the road for transfer to an Undertaker.",52
Milestone,2008-01-24,02:00,1,"The party of three friends were attempting the Grade 1 scramble in Little Gully at the side of the Milestone Buttress. They were a well equipped and experienced party, but unluckily one of the group slipped on wet rock and sustained a tumbling fall of about 80ft. Two Plas y Brenin instructors climbing on the Milestone went to his aid immediately, and looked after him whilst waiting for the emergency services to be alerted. Helimed managed to land a Paramedic close to the scene. Shortly after OVMRO members reached the incident site and 22 Squadron arrived. A multi-agency effort, on difficult ground, managed to swiftly treat and load the patient onto a stretcher before being evacuated by 22 Squadron to Ysbyty Gwynedd. A very lucky man not to have sustained far worse injuries.",51
Tryfan Summit,2008-01-20,01:30,1,"The party of two fell runners had run from Aber, over the Carneddau, and up Tryfan on their way to the Glyderau and then Snowdon. Unfortunately, one of them tripped on the summit of Tryfan, somersaulted and banged his head on a boulder resulting in a deep laceration to his scalp. A passer-by quickly applied an effective bandage and phoned for assistance. Much confusion followed with the ambulance service and Helimed being tasked first, then a rumour of 22 squadron being on route, then OVMRO were called. The Team Leader started the Team call-out, however, after talking to the casualty directly, it was decided that he could walk down and would be met by 2 OVMRO members going up. All other services were stood down, and the party were brought to Oggie Base for a check-up and to be returned to their transport at Llanberis. The casualty was advised to attend the local hospital.",50
Llanwrst,2008-01-16,03:00,1,"About 15:30, after school, the casualty and her friend were walking her dog up the river behind the Leisure Centre in Llanrwst. As her friend climbed up on to the river bank she dislodged a large rock which hit the casualty on the foot. The two girls felt unable to get the casualty out of the river and woods unaided, so the friend returned to Llanrwst to get help. An ambulance crew arrived on scene about 17:00 but were unable to evacuate the casualty due to the nature of the terrain (dense woodland and swollen river). OVMRO were called and were on scene by 18:00. Team members evacuated her by stretcher along the river and then through thick undergrowth to the waiting ambulance.",49
Notch Gully - Tryfan East Face,2008-01-15,05:00,2,"The two girls had climbed Tryfan via the Heather Terrace and the South Ridge, and intended returning by the same route. After a short rest on the summit they were persuaded by two men to follow them down the North ridge. This seemed like a good idea until the two men disappeared into the cloud, never to be seen again! The girls spent a considerable amount of time wandering around the upper north ridge and west face area before becoming totally stuck about 50 metres down Notch Gully. Several hill parties were dispatched to try to locate them. Once found they were assisted back up the gully and short roped off via Western Gully. Luckily, they remained in good spirits throughout the whole incident.",48
The Band - Langdale,2008-01-13,02:00,1,"Members of the Team were camping in Langdale for a Training weekend. They were asked to assist with a stretcher carry from the Band, for a man with a suspected leg injury. Nine Team members joined forces with the Langdale/Ambleside Team for a short stretcher evacuation to the roadhead.",47
Carneddau,2008-01-10,06:30,2,"The pair were walking the 14 Peaks on their second attempt this year and became lost on the ridge between Carnedd Llewellyn and Foel Grach in strong winds and heavy rain. They called 999 for help and were advised to head down Gledrffordd to more sheltered ground. The team were called with the plan of meeting the pair and escorting them safely off the hill. Unfortunately the pair kept walking and were eventually located at the top of serious ground whilst heading downhill towards, drawn like moths to a lamp, the lights of a spotter vehicle at the Eigiau dam. A very wet and cold pair were returned to a waiting parent at Trawsbwll. The pair had set off rather late from Snowdon and had not paid enough attention to the weather forecast or their own navigation skills.",46
Milestone Buttress,2008-01-10,02:15,1,"The casualty had started up Tryfan at midday. On the way back down the North Ridge he managed to stray on to the top of the Milestone Buttress, possibly due to poor visibility in the passing showers. Having descended a short gully he became stuck, and phoned for help. An easy extraction for the Team.",45
Milestone Buttress,2008-01-05,02:30,3,The group set out at 10am to climb Tryfan via the Heather Terrace and North Gully. In poor weather conditions they made it to the top of North Gully and then descended the North ridge until becoming cragfast somewhere above the Milestone Buttress. A small party of Team members were deployed to locate and retrieve the group.,44
Llanberis Pass,2008-01-30,05:15,4,"A family of 4 consisting of two adults and two children (aged 11 and 9) were reported to be stuck in a gully in darkness and not knowing where they were located. They were reported to have no torch, map etc but did have a good mobile phone. On questioning, they had left their car at Ogwen at 11:00hrs and did a scramble route to the summit of Glyder Fawr arriving at the summit at 17:00hrs. They then became disorientated and descended arriving near Pen-Y-Pass. Recognising this location, they headed back up into the cloud and darkness to get back to Ogwen. They became disorientated yet again and eventually became stuck on dangerous ground. The adult informant could see a house and a road with car headlights; he firmly believed himself to be in the Ogwen Valley close to the A5 and Ogwen Cottage. After much detective work, the group were located in the Llanberis Pass alongside the Cromlech in a gully. They were helped off the hill by team members. The informant was amazed that he was in the Llanberis Pass and later revealed that he did have a map and compass but probably did not know how to use them.",43
"Heather Terrace, Tryfan",2008-01-24,03:00,1,"The casualty and his wife were descending the Heather Terrace when he stumbled and his knee gave way. A passer by called for assistance as the casualty felt he could no longer walk. Although initial reports were of a head injury, which is why 22 squadron were requested, it became apparent that the casualty actually felt lightheaded and faint which was probably from pain.The Team attended the incident site, splinted the leg and 22 sqn evacuated the casualty to hospital.",42
West face Tryfan,2008-01-23,01:20,2,"The pair ascended the North Ridge of Tryfan but did not feel they could scramble the upper section, so retraced their steps. Unfortunately, they wandered on to the West face and became stuck. As the first party set out to find them they quickly became unstuck when a passing person offered to walk down with them. Probably an unnecessary call-out.",41
Glyder Fawr?,2008-01-19,00:50,2,"The casualties called NWP for assistance as they were lost in cloud. They stated they were on Glyder Fawr, but also mentioned the Cantilever. OVMRO Team Leader was unable to contact them on their mobile phone, so the Team were put on stand-by whilst waiting for further contact from the casualties. As predicted, another phone call 30 mins later confirmed that they had met up with another group who would show them the way down.A totally unnecessary call from a poorly equipped group.",40
Milestone Buttress,2008-01-12,05:00,2,"Father and son intended to climb Direct Route on the Milestone, starting at 16:00. They never found Direct Route and actually climbed Rowan Route instead reaching the top at 20:10. By this time they were in cloud and rain and they were not happy to take the normal descent route due to water pouring down it. They attempted to find an alternative way down by traversing and ascending the broken ground above the Milestone, however darkness won the race and their torches were at the bottom in their rucksacks. They found shelter and called for help. The Teams on the hill found it difficult to locate the pair as they could only shine the light of their mobile phone and visibility was greatly reduced by the heavy rain showers. Once located a speedy evacuation reunited them with their mountain boots, rucksacks etc and they were taken to Base to warm up.",39
Devil's Kitchen,2008-01-09,01:40,1,"A party from OVMRO, just setting out on the hill for the Oggie 8 challenge, were asked to look out for the DoE group by their leaders who were slightly concerned as the group were overdue in atrocious weather conditions. Team members met up with the DoE group on the path by the Devil’s Kitchen. One of the party seemed very wet and unwell so assistance was requested from Base. A small party of MRT made their way to the location and escorted the whole party back to Idwal carpark.",38
Tryfan East Face,2008-01-03,10:00,1,"Continuation of missing person search from 28/07/08. On the evening of 2 nd August a member of the public discovered a rucksack on the Heather terrace at the base of North Gully. Its contents were broken and it contained a mobile phone. It was given to NWP who later confirmed it belonged to the missing person. Team members started searching the surrounding area early the next morning, working in very exposed dangerous terrain. Several other personal items were discovered above the rucksack. Assistance was also provided by NWP helicopter and 22 Squadron. After 5 hrs, a body was located approximately 200m below the Heather Terrace in the direct fall-line from North Gully. The Fatal Incident Protocol was carried out, then the body was carried down from the mountainside and taken to Ysbyty Gwynedd for identification.",37
NA,2008-01-28,01:00,NA,"The owners of Gwern Gof Isaf had reported to NWP that the owner of a motorcycle and tent located at their campsite had not been seen for several days and had only paid until Thurs July 24th. The Team were asked to search the tent and motorcycle for any clues as to the whereabouts of its owner. Normal camping kit was found but no obvious route intentions. The Police had already contacted a family member who was concerned that the missing person had depressive tendencies.

No further action to be taken at this stage until the Police have checked the home address of the missing person and carried out further investigations.",36
Moel Siabod,2008-01-28,05:00,1,"The casualty and her daughter were walking uphill on Moel Siabod when she suddenly experienced severe pain in her big toe (no trauma sustained). She felt unable to walk any further and called for help. Unfortunately her map reading was poor, and the grid reference she gave had the Team member sent to round her up climbing over the ridge of Siabod from the north and then descending steep ground to Llyn y Foel where she was located. Having waited so long she had now decided that she could walk. She was given pain relief and some walking poles and managed to walk to the Landrover at the head of the track. She was taken to Ysbyty Gwynedd and left in the hands of a GP.",35
Silver Fountain on A5,2008-01-23,01:00,1,The Team were asked by NWP to assist with the extraction of a motorcyclist who had fallen down a steep bank after a RTC. Poor communications meant that the Team were sent to various locations before the final rendezvous at the Silver Fountain on the A5. By this time the FRS and ambulance crew had treated the casualty and loaded him on to a stretcher. Team members assisted with the carry out to the road.,34
Moel Faban,2008-01-22,01:40,1,"The casualty was a fit hill walker who met with a group of friends every Tuesday to go walking in the hills. The intended route this day was to walk up to Drosgl, Bera Bach, Garnedd Ugain then return down the Afon Wen. Unfortunately, the group had only got as far as Moel Faban when he suddenly collapsed without warning. His friends called for assistance and then proceeded to perform CPR for 45 minutes until the first rescue team member was on scene. Three MRT members individually assessed the casualty for signs of life but found none. At this stage CPR was stopped. 22 Squadron airlifted the casualty to Ysbyty Gwynedd where it was confirmed that he had passed away. The rest of the party were escorted from the hillside by MRT members.",33
Tryfan,2008-01-21,02:30,1,"The casualty, who was in an organised party, slipped and took a tumbling fall down the path on the South Ridge of Tryfan, in the process injuring his hand, shoulder, ribs and head. One party leader descended with the remainder of the group, and the second party leader remained with the casualty until 22 sqn arrived. The winchman asked for assistance to move the casualty so 3 MRT members were flown to the cas site. The casualty was then flown to Ysbyty Gwynedd for treatment.",32
Melin y Coed,2008-01-17,03:25,1,"The missing person was last seen on Monday 14th July 2008. A resident of Melin y Coed noticed that his van had been parked for 3 days in the same place on a country lane just outside the village. On trying to contact the owner, the informant discovered that the missing person had not been home for 3 days. SARDA were initially called to search the woodland close to the vehicle, and a body was quickly located. OVMRO team members were called to carry out the extrication of the body from a wooded gorge to the roadside.",31
Dolwyddelan / A5,2008-01-20,11:00,NA,07:30 Continuation of yesterday's search. 18:30,30
Dolwyddelan / A5,2008-01-19,06:00,1,"The missing person was last seen on Monday 16th June getting onto a train from Dolwyddelan at midday. Further sightings the same day in Betws and walking along the A5 near Capel Curig were later confirmed. He was reported missing by his family on Thurs 19th June. NWP searched his home address and it was evident that he had not returned home at any point. The Team searched the area surrounding his home on Friday evening, and then several MRTS were deployed on Saturday to search his possible route along the A5. No sign of the missing person was found, so the search was called off awaiting further instructions from NWP.",29
Colwyn Bay Area,2008-01-06,01:00,1,"The Team were called to assist SARDA and NEWSAR search for a person missing from home, in the Colwyn Bay area.

Below Llyn Geirionydd,2008-01-06,02:15,1,"This 10-year-old girl was with a school group, staying at a local centre, who were exploring the gorge below Llyn Geirionydd. At some point she entered a horizontal mine shaft and wandered into the darkness. She did not see the vertical shaft in the floor until she fell approximately 8m into it. The group organisers decided it would be best to seek expert help in case she was injured, so sent one leader to a phonebox to summon help. This is one of the few places in this area with no mobile phone signal. The Team and Helimed attended the scene and worked together to extract the girl, on a spinal stretcher, and then she was flown to Ysbyty Gwynedd for a check up.",27
Moel Siabod,2008-01-17,03:40,2,"The couple called for help from the summit shelter of Moel Siabod as they were lost(!). They had no map, no compass and no idea which way to walk down. However, they did have a spare cardigan. Although it was very cold on the summit they were not prepared to move before the Rescue Team arrived. A small party was dispatched to guide them from the mountain. This was a definite case of poor preparation, poor equipment and total lack of knowledge of the mountains. They failed to appreciate the inconvenience that their irresponsible actions caused to others.",26
Bristly Ridge,2008-01-13,03:00,1,"This well-equipped group of three were nearing the top of Bristly Ridge when the casualty had a tumbling fall of about 7m, sustaining possible hand and head injuries.

The following morning they set out again, however the casualty was blown over by the wind after only walking a short distance, so they retreated to the refuge hut to assess his injuries. He had sustained facial and rib injuries in his fall and they decided it would be wise to ask for help at this stage.

Parties of team members were sent to climb up the area of Grooved Arete to evacuate the pair who were now getting cold as temperatures quickly dropped. The RAF helicopter was requested to assist and was fortunately able to winch both climbers to safety in some spectacular night flying.

Three of them turned up in Trefriw several hours later but could not make contact with the fourth member of their group and reported him missing. After careful questioning by a Team Leader it would appear that they had taken the wrong direction from the summit of Llewelyn and were probably on Pen Llithrig y Wrach when they thought they were on Foel Fras.

After 3 hours it started to get dark and they called for help. Their knowledge of their location was poor, but using local area knowledge the Team was able to approximate their location. This was backed up when one of the group had enough signal to reply to the SARLOC message sent to them (the one with better signal had no credit on his phone, so could not follow the link). A team member who knows the forest tracks was dispatched to recover the group. It was decided that it was not worth the risk to team member or team vehicles to try and pull theirs out.

On the way down he lost his camera and spent some time looking for it so it was nearly dark as he approached the forest. He did not reach the access path and was unsure which way to go so rang for assistance. The Team were unable to gain any contact with him so hill parties and 22 Squadron were tasked to search three probable areas.

One of the dogs was stuck on a ledge and they could not retrace their steps back up the gully. A hasty party set out to locate and secure them and a request for 22 Squadron was made, however the helicopter was not available. A large group of RAF Valley MRT members arrived to assist and with a joint effort, and a lot of dog biscuits, the men and their dogs were taken back up the gully to the summit. The practicality of lowering a large unhappy Rotweiller down the cliff was too complicated! There followed a slow descent down Cwm Tryfan to Oggie Base for a debrief.",50

Around midday, a passing walker came across the casualty who was in need of help to get off the mountain. Given the age of the casualty, the reported injuries and the elapsed time, it was agreed with the ARCC that the best response was R122 with RAF MRS onboard.

The ambulance crew and informant had meanwhile started to climb up to the casualty, soon joined by a team leader. A back-up stretcher party was also deployed and 22 Squadron requested when it became clear that the casualty was on very steep ground high up on the mountain.

Shortly afterwards she was located close to Llyn Idwal and the pair were reunited. It remains a mystery as to how she passed him on a relatively narrow path in perfect visibility. Good intent and good outcome.,38

Due to concerns for his safety, a search was started. Given the circumstances, it was agreed that MRT would only provide advice on search parameters and search management. During the day, SARDA were called and deployed to the scene and assisted the Police in marking search areas etc. The missing person was subsequently discovered hiding in the area and was detained by North Wales Police",25
Bangor,2014-01-25,00:35,1,"The missing person wandered away from a shop and was later seen moving through gardens and attempting to enter houses etc. Given the onset of darkness and concerns for the safety of the missing person, North Wales Police and their PolSA requested support from MRT in the search planning role to supplement the urban searching being done by Police Officers. As the Search Managers were mobilising, we were informed that the missing person had been located entering a flat some distance uphill from the initial planning point. It seems that he had struggled through gardens and undergrowth whilst going uphill.",24
Moel Siabod,2014-01-19,03:40,2,"A couple had set off in the morning to climb Moel Siabod via a scramble having looked at a general weather forecast and using their Smart phone to navigate. The mountain forecast (which they had not seen) was for 70mph winds in the afternoon. Just after lunch time they found the winds too srong to be able to move and lost confidence, took shelter, and phoned for assistance.
A trainee team leader attempted to talk them in to ascending a short way to the NE ridge of Moel Siabod which they could then descend to meet a hill party that was going to collect them with confidence ropes and additional warm clothing. They were able to get to the ridge, but rather than following this down they headed towards Plas y Brenin, thus missing the hill party. A further telephone conversation indicated they had reached the forest so the hill party returned to Capel Curig to find them getting in to their car ready to go to the pub! Although they only had a mobile phone for navigation, this was not the cause of the callout. Their main mistake was not looking at a mountain forecast.",23
Devils' Kitchen,2014-01-16,06:45,2,"A pair of walkers were walking Tryfan and the Glyders but when passing Castle of the Winds in cloud they became lost and went down towards Cwm Ffynnon and realised that they were heading in the wrong direction. They then went back uphill and were unable to determine their location and so called for assistance. SARLOC did not work possibly due to poor phone signal strength at the lost person location and so a number of MRT parties were sent to try to locate the group. After some further questioning, the location was identified as near the top of Col Gully. Team Members subsequently located the group and escorted them off the hill to safety down the Col Gully to Bochlwyd.",22

The following day a small hill party went back to the scene with more equipment and managed to recover the dog which was unhurt, and it was taken to a local vet practice to be checked out.

The walker was able to find a path and then was happy to continue his descent to Bethesda via Yr Elen. He was asked to activate SARLOC periodically so the TL could monitor his progress.,17
Pen yr Ole Wen,2018-01-04,04:10,1,A male walker slipped on ice on the South West descent from Pen yr Ole Wen and tumbled a short distance. He suffered a potentially serious head injury so the Coastguard Helicopter was requested as MRT were being deployed. An assessment by the Winchman Paramedic and the Team doctor meant that he could be winched off the mountain for a possible transfer to the air ambulance and then to Stoke trauma centre. His friends were assisted off the mountain by team members.,16
"Y Gully, Tryfan",2018-01-03,08:55,3,Three poorly equipped males set off at midday to climb Tryfan which was in winter conditions. They ascended the South Ridge and then tried to descend the North Ridge but strayed on to the dangerous area of the West face in the Y Gully area. Inevitably they became stuck in the steep gully and could not move. Their position was confirmed with SARLOC and a large party of team members battled severe weather conditions to reach them. They were individually lowered to the bottom of the gully and then walked off the mountain.,15
Bristley Ridge,2018-01-28,02:10,1,"A group of University students were scrambling on Bristley Ridge when a dislodged rock hit one of them in the face, causing a deep gash. Although he initially felt nauseous he felt able to walk down unassisted. The group leader alerted the team in case the situation changed. He kept in touch with the Ogwen TL via text messages until the whole group was safely off the hill. No MRT action needed.",14
East Face Tryfan,2018-01-27,00:50,12,There was a report of flashing lights on the East Face of Tryfan. The informant was certain there could be people in difficulty so called 999. A couple of team members already at Oggie Base spent some time investigating the report but no lights were seen. No action taken.,13
Y Garn,2018-01-26,01:35,3,A poorly equipped couple with a 5 year old child reported themselves lost in the dark in the area of the Devil's Kitchen. SARLOC was used to locate them SW of the summit of Y Garn. Because of the freezing temperatures and the small child involved it was decided that R936 Coastguard Helicopter would be the best resource. Whilst team members prepared at Oggie Base the aircraft was able to locate the casualty party and then fly them to Base for a warm up.,12
Bangor,2018-01-25,05:40,1,"OVMRO were requested by NWP to assist with a SARDA search of woodlands near the Menai Straits, at Upper Bangor.

Milestone Buttress area,2018-01-25,04:10,6,"6 people reported themselves stuck somewhere on the North Ridge of Tryfan. Unfortunately that was the only info received by the TL as repeated phonecalls back to them went straight to voicemail. With only 2 hrs to darkness, low temperatures and limited number of team members it was decided to ask for the help of the Coastguard helicopter. They were able to locate the group who were just above the Milestone Buttress and close to a path. It was decided that a winch from that location did not justify the risk as they were on safe ground. Therefore 4 hill members deployed to walk them off.",10
Coastal path above Sychnant,2018-01-21,03:00,1,"A female walker on the North Wales Coastal Path suffered a leg injury and asked for assistance. Local team members went direct to the scene whilst the Team vehicle with kit was being deployed from Oggie Base.

Tryfan,2018-01-15,08:00,1,"At first light members from all 6 North Wales MRTs, RAF Valley MRT, and SARDA were all deployed onto Tryfan to search for the missing walker. The aim was to cover all the high priority areas as the weather was due to improve throughout the day. The assistance of the Coastguard Helicopter from Caernarfon was also authorised but not used due to the high winds. Mid morning the walker was found on the West side of Tryfan but had sadly not survived. More team members were sent to the location with extra equipment, and the walker was brought to the roadside on a stretcher.",7
Tryfan,2018-01-14,08:00,1,"The team were called out as an experienced, well equipped walker had not returned from a planned climb up the North Ridge of Tryfan. As he was several hours overdue and the weather was forecast to deteriorate significantly overnight, several hill parties were deployed on to the mountain to search for him.

The search teams were stood down at 4am, and TLs planned the search areas for the morning when other MRTs were being called in.",6
Dolarrog,2018-01-13,01:55,2,A mother and daughter reported themselves lost above Dolgarrog.

East Face Tryfan,2018-01-10,01:30,2,"Two walkers had attempted the North Ridge of Tryfan but had found the icy conditions high up challenging. In an attempt to retreat they unfortunately chose to descend North Gully and then traverse out below North Buttress, until they could go no further.

No shouts were heard and there were no further reports to NWP, so no further action was taken.",114
"North Gully, Tryfan",2019-01-01,08:50,3,"A party of three rang for help after attempting a scramble up Little Gully and North Gully on the East Face of Tryfan. They thought they were about 20m below the ridge line when they became stuck. However when the first hill party ascended Western Gully and looked down North Gully it became apparent that the stuck party were much further down than they had claimed, close to the junction of Little Gully and North Gully.

Gallt yr Ogof,2019-01-25,07:30,1,Sadly this incident was the same as the previous one a week earlier. The same vulnerable male rang the ambulance service in a distressed state and his phone was traced to the ridge line East of Gallt yr Ogof. A large hill party was sent to that location and found the male but he refused to walk off the mountain. Because there was a risk for his safety several Police Officers and a Police negotiator became involved to assist with his extraction. He finally agreed to walk down and left with the Police Officers.,112
Cwm Idwal,2019-01-18,04:20,1,"The ambulance service requested assistance from the team as they had received a call from a vulnerable male claiming to be on Glyder Fawr. There was limited information about his possible location and no way of contacting him. A hasty hill party was deployed to investigate a possible sighting earlier in the day and other parties were formed to be airlifted by Coastguard Helicopter onto Glyder Fawr to start a search of the main paths. SARDA was also asked for search dog availability. The initial hill party found the male in Cwm Idwal in a distressed state, talked to him for some time and then persuaded him to return to the road with them. He was then transferred to hospital for assessment.",111
Cwm Idwal,2019-01-18,02:40,1,"The team were called to a male walker who had slipped on ice close to Llyn Idwal and injured his knee.

The weather was poor and he had no idea of the terrain he was trying to negotiate, this resulted in him getting lost and struggling through wet, boggy ground above Bethesda. When he called for help he was only 15 mins from the road but felt unable to move by himself. Two team members located him, gave him warm clothes and hot drinks and then walked him back to Bethesda.

Cwm Llafar,2019-01-09,01:15,4,"An experienced group of four became cragfast on the cliffs to the west of Crib Lem as they had thought this would be an easier scramble to the top than the Llech Ddu spur. However, the slush/ snow conditions proved more difficult the higher they climbed and it soon became apparent that a descent the same way would be dangerous. They called for help but initially comms were intermittent and very broken. Once it was established where they were the Coastguard Helicopter was requested due to the poor terrain and fading light. Luckily they were already out training so were diverted to the incident site, winched the group aboard and dropped them off at Oggie Base. The hill party deploying from Gerlan was stood down.",108

Ogwen Valley area,2019-01-17,02:30,1,"A solo male walker rang 999 to say he was stuck on a cliff edge. He was unable to give any idea of his location except he could see a road and maybe Ogwen Cottage where he had parked his car, and no further calls would connect with his phone.

The other members of her group tried to assist her down but it was too painful so they asked for assistance. One team member passing by was on scene within minutes and recommended an aircraft if possible. Unfortunately the Coastguard Helicopter was already tasked to a serious incident in Mid Wales, so a small hill party deployed with as much kit as they could carry. Valley MRT, who were training in the Moelwyns, were put on stand by as there were not enough Oggie team members for a stretcher carry from the summit. The Coastguard helicopter became available just as the stretcher party arrived at the cas site, so the lady was quickly packaged in the stretcher and winched aboard for a short flight to hospital.",86

She spent a long time trying to find a safe way down in the darkness but finally asked for help. Unfortunately she did not have a smart phone so she could not be located that way, however she was able to use her map and compass to provide extra information. Initially it seemed that she was on the east side of Moel Wynion. She agreed to sit down and wait for daylight as it was a warm night and she had no other problems. In the morning the TL contacted her again and after much discussion and map reading they worked out that she was actually on the west slopes of Llwytmor.

Again poor Comms and a poor description of his location meant that the Coastguard helicopter was re-tasked after refuelling at Caernarfon base. The crew soon spotted the male, winched him on board and dropped him at Oggie base to be reunited with the rest of his group.",76
West Face of Tryfan,2019-01-21,02:30,1,"A male walker, part of a large group, became separated from the rest of his group on the descent of the North Ridge of Tryfan.

Carnedd Llewelyn,2020-01-16,05:10,2,"Two males found themselves lost in fog whilst ascending the NE Ridge of Carnedd Llewelyn in the early evening. Although their position was known using Phonefind they were reluctant to be guided down by phone. This resulted in a long wait for them whilst team members walked up to them and then guided them back down the mountain. No map,no compass.",53
Betws y Coed,2020-01-16,02:40,1,"Welsh Ambulance Service requested assistance from the team to extract an injured mountain biker who had fallen into a small ravine. The female had lost control on a bend and crashed over the wall, falling some distance though trees. With suspected spinal and chest injuries she was placed on a vacmat and then moved by stretcher back to the road and the ambulance.",52
West face of Tryfan,2020-01-15,04:25,4,"Yet another preventable call out on the West Face of Tryfan. A group of 9 males left London at 4am, chose Tryfan as their walk and attempted it with no equipment, no experience and no knowledge of the route. Two of them soon pulled ahead and made it to the summit, three decided to go back down at an early stage and the remaining 4 continued slowly upwards. The summit pair rang the group of 4 and advised them to turn back which they did, but they had no idea how to get down and strayed off the ridge on to the west face. One male then had a panic attack and could no longer move due to extreme exhaustion. A hill party located them and started to slowly move the whole group up hill to the ridge. By this time the Coastguard Rescue Helicopter from St Athan was in the area, having been called to an incident on Snowdon. R936 became available and dealt with the Snowdon incident so R187 was able to winch the tired male from the ridge and drop him off at Oggie Base. He admitted he had a history of panic attacks.",51
Afon Llafar,2020-01-13,03:45,1,A party of 4 reported that one of the group had jumped off a wall on the hillside above Gerlan and had possibly broken his ankle. Phonefind placed them about 1km from the road so a hasty party deployed to assess the situation followed by a stretcher party. Once on scene a team doctor decided that a stretcher evacuation was necessary so the casualty was carried down to the road and sent off in a taxi to the local hospital.,50
Moel Siabod,2020-01-13,03:55,5,"Two adults, three children and a dog lost in cloud on the summit ridge of Moel Siabod.

A small hill party walked up to them and brought them back down to the road.",49
Ogwen/ Idwal area,2020-01-12,00:35,2,"Two teenagers had been for a long walk on the mountains, possibly in the Devil's Kitchen area. They rang their father to say they had reached a road but did not recognise where they were. The father had driven along the obvious roads but found no sign of them. As the TL was collecting more information the family called to say the boys were on the A5 near Capel Curig and no further assistance was needed.",48
North Ridge Tryfan,2020-01-08,03:00,1,A man asked for help as his large dog was on the ridge close to the summit and refused to move. A team member close by went to his assistance whilst another 2 team members set off up the North Ridge. The dog was moved to safety and was able to walk back down the mountain with the team.,47
Idwal Buttress,2020-01-08,03:15,1,"Two males were scrambling in the Idwal Buttress area when one jumped down a short distance, landed badly and injured his ankle. Due to the high location and good weather, assistance from the Coastguard Rescue helicopter was requested.

Team members and the winchman packaged the casualty on a stretcher and he was winched into the heli for transfer to hospital.",46
"Y Gully, Tryfan",2020-01-06,03:20,3,"A group of 3 females called 999 as they were stuck in a gully on Tryfan. They were well equipped but felt unable to descend further or to go back up. Poor comms with this party meant the spotter was back out on the A5 and located them low down in Y Gully on the West Face. The Coastguard Rescue Helicopter was tasked on their route back from the Lake District but initially could not assist due to the low cloud base. However, they dropped 4 MRT at the base of the gully and then, due to a short clearance in the cloud, winched the three females and dropped them off with the MRT. From there everyone could walk down to the road safely.",45
West face Tryfan,2020-01-06,04:50,7,A party of 3 adults and 4 children became stuck on the West Face above Wrinkled Slab whilst trying to descend the North Ridge in cloud. Although they were not on steep ground they lacked confidence to find their way down. No comms were possible with the party but a spotter on the A5 managed to locate a large non-moving party.

Once there the adults were able to walk back up to the ridge and the children were put on confidence ropes.,44
Penmaenmawr,2020-01-05,01:35,9,A party of nine (2 adults and 7 children aged between 3 and 19 years) became stuck on steep ground whilst trying to descend from the North Wales Coastal Path into Penmaenmawr.

They were given directions on how to get back to Penmaenmawr and team members returned home.,43
Moel Siabod,2020-01-30,01:00,2,"Two people reported themselves lost on the SW side of Moel Siabod and on boggy ground. Phonefind put them about 200m from Llyn y Foel which they had passed on their way up. A text was sent to them telling them to walk to the lake and regain the path, which they did.

Glyder Fawr face,2020-01-24,07:10,3,"A group of 3 male hill walkers had already completed Tryfan and Bristly Ridge when they went astray in the Glyder Fach/ Fawr area. They reported themselves as stuck and unable to safely move up or down. Hill parties were deployed and the Coastguard helicopter was also tasked to locate them and extract if weather conditions were suitable. Unbelievably they were located on the 3rd pitch of Faith,a VDiff rock climb on the Idwal Slabs, not a normal choice of descent for hill walkers with no climbing equipment! Team members climbed up the normal descent route and then set up a rope system to bring the walkers back up to the top of the crag. From there they were assisted down the normal descent route and walked off the mountain.",41
Aber Falls,2020-01-21,04:15,1,"A female walker, on a day out with her two teenagers, slipped close to the small waterfall at Abergwyngregyn. She sustained a lower leg injury and was unable to walk so a passer by walked down a short distance to obtain a phone signal and request help. The call initially went to the ambulance service but was then transferred to the team due to the location. Team members met up at the base of Aber Falls and then took all the equipment 300m along the path to the cas site. The lady's leg was splinted, and then she was stretchered to the team landrover to be driven down to the road. A friend was then going to drive her to hospital.",40
Above Glan Dena,2020-01-19,02:20,1,"A member of the public reported that he had seen flashing lights on the hillside at about 9pm. He had then gone for a walk and the lights were still there on his return about 1am. He felt that they were responding to his light so called NWP and expressed his concern. After a discussion with an Oggie TL the informant agreed to approach the area of the lights to gain more information, but he could find no-one in that area. NWP had no other calls reporting the lights so the incident was closed.",39

"Grey Slabs, Glyder Fawr",2020-01-17,05:10,1,"As the first call-out was ending the team were then called to a solo male scrambler stuck on Grey Slab area of Glyder Fawr. He had climbed to a point where he could neither go up nor down safely so wisely rang for help. The weather was not suitable for a helicopter rescue so a large hill party deployed to Cwm Idwal to locate and extract him. Two members climbed into his location from below whilst the remainder of the team set up a rope system above him. The casualty plus 2 TMs were then hauled to the top of the crag, moved to safe ground and then walked off back to Ogwen carpark.",37

Lliwedd,2020-01-14,10:20,3,"The team were asked by Llanberis MRT to assist with the extraction of 3 climbers high up on the face of Lliwedd. One of the party was unable to continue and they did not have torches to aid a descent. In a joint operation, rope rescue kit was carried to the top of Lliwedd and then Llanberis team members were lowered down to the stuck party who were then lowered to the base of the cliff. The party were very cold and wet (no waterproofs)but could walk to the team vehicles to be returned to Peris Base.

Team members who had just completed a training session at Oggie Base were deployed to Bryn Hall RV. From here two vehicles drove up to 5 ways whilst the rest of the team walked up. Luckily the Coastguard Rescue helicopter became available to assist after attending a call out in NE Wales, so team members remained at 5 ways until the winchman had recovered the lady to the aircraft. Team stood down.",32
North Ridge Tryfan,2020-01-07,06:45,3,Two days after travel restrictions were lifted in Wales the team were predictably called for 3 people lost on the North Ridge of Tryfan in the forecast heavy rain and poor visibility.

Wets Face Tryfan,2020-01-23,03:30,1,"Unbelievably, yet another one!
A solo male walker with no experience and wearing trainers decided to walk up Tryfan to take photos. He tried to descend the West Face and became trapped in a steep gully so asked for help. A small hill party located him, roped to safe ground and walked him off the hill.
His parting question 'where can I go tomorrow to take photos?'!!!!!",27

His initial call to NWP suggested he was exhausted, lost and could not move, however he gave no information on his location. No contact could be made with the walker so the search was started around the phone triangulation position, whic was close to the old road between Capel Curig and Ogwen. This was searched twice before he finally stumbled off the hill and bumped into one of the search parties. He was brought back to Oggie Base to dry off and have a debrief.
Apparently after leaving the group close to Tryfan Bach because he felt unfit, he then changed his mind and walked up to Bwlch Tryfan with the hope of meeting up with the rest of the group. He then realised it was too steep so tried to retrace his steps which resulted in him getting totally lost in the dark in the Cwm Tryfan area.",24
East Face Tryfan,2020-01-07,11:05,4,"A party of 4 walkers set off at midday hoping to climb North Gully on Tryfan, however they decided to change their plan as the weather started to deteriorate. Somehow they managed to traverse steep and dangerous ground underneath the North Buttress and ended up in the Haven area of Grooved Arete, a V Diff rock climb! At this point they could proceed no further and rang for help. In high winds and increasing rain the first hill party, having being recalled from an incident on Snowdon, set off to locate them. Although the team had a Phonefind location to assist the search, it was impossible to make voice contact due to the high winds and the group only had 2 small torches to try to attract attention. They were finally located tucked into a crevice about 70m below the Eastern Traverse, so more ropes were sent up the mountain with the back up party to set up a TRR system.The first casualty hauled up was not in a great condition so was immediately walked down by 2 team member whilst the rest of the group were being hauled up. At this point there was a brief weather window when the Coastguard Helicopter, who had been on stand by most of the evening, were able to fly in and extract the group and team members. Difficult flying meant that all the team kit had to be left behind on the North Ridge, so if you pass that way please consider bringing some of it back to us!!",23
