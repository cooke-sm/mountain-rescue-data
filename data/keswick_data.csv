"The team received a call from a concerned walker who thought they could see an orange survival bag and could hear whistling just below the rock buttress of Hind crag. KMRT sent a truck to investigate further. Once at Seathwaite farm, team members spoke to students from a university who were surveying the area and were using orange markers as part of their study. Just to be sure team members double checked the location and confirmed it to be an orange marker. A false alarm with good intent.

"At 1820 on Tuesday evening, Wasdale, Cockermouth and Keswick MR teams were called to search for a missing 36 year old male fell runner who had become separated from his partner whilst attempting to run legs 3 and 4 of the Bob Graham Round. The runners had been descending from Red Pike heading for Little Scoat Fell at a height of around 750-850m when they became separated. When the bad weather arrived, the running partner backtracked to a point where he believed he would meet up with his partner but was unable to find him in the thick cloud. After searching for a considerable time in worsening weather, he eventually gave up and made his way over to Black Sail Pass. From here he was able to see Black Sail Youth Hostel and he made his way down to the hut and raised the alarm.
Over 60 team members from Wasdale, Cockermouth and Keswick MR teams along with search dogs carried out a thorough search of all major footpaths and all obvious escape routes along the planned route in strong wind, heavy rain and thick cloud until approximately 0200 the next morning. At that point with no further information on the location of the fell runner and the difficult search conditions which prohibited the use of a helicopter, the very difficult decision was taken to call the search off until first light. The search was resumed again at 0500 on Wednesday 2nd May with additional team members from Penrith MRT, Kirkby Stephen MRT, Coniston MRT, Kendal MRT and Northumberland MRT. The coastguard search and rescue helicopter also joined the search at that point.
At approximately 0730, the missing fell runner was found and was flown by coastguard helicopter to the RVI hospital in Newcastle. Sadly, they were unable to resuscitate him. This was a major search involving over 100 rescuers, 9 dogs, a coastguard helicopter and much assistance from the NWAS Air Desk and Cumbria Police. It’s always very difficult mounting a search like this covering such a large area, with a potentially moving casualty at night and in challenging weather conditions and low visibility so there was always a low probability of a find at night which unfortunately proved to be the case.
This was an experienced fell runner doing something that many of our team members enjoy so it was a particularly poignant call out for many. 22 Keswick team members – 8 hours 40 minutes",,ennerdale-buttermere-honister-fells

"Two ladies, one 7 months pregnant, had walked from Seathwaite to Scafell Pike arriving on the summit around 5pm with plenty of daylight to return. On their descent, the 6 year old husky gave up and would walk no further despite the lure of treats. One of our team members who lives close to the location set off first with his daughter, a student vet. They were followed by a vehicle of team members and one of our search dog handlers. It was quickly obvious that the dog would not be able to walk down, it made 2 steps with some gentle persuasion and loads of treats and stopped, so she was placed in a kind of nest made from our casualty bag, put onto the stretcher, strapped in and carried down arriving back in the valley at Seathwaite around 2am.
The owner kindly updated us the next day and it turned out the dog had lacerations on its paws explaining it’s reluctance to walk.

A father and son attempted to walk a direct route up the steep front face (bracken and scree) of Carrock Fell above the road and became crag fast.

He declared himself fit to walk, but as they neared Sty Head, he became unsteady, and the group stopped. In the meantime, the Team had mobilised swiftly and had enquired about the availability of an Air Ambulance. Initially this was thought unnecessary as he was a walking casualty. However, when the Team arrived on scene at the casualty , they discovered that his initial fall had been a 60m tumbling slide which ended with him colliding with a boulder at the foot of a snow slope ! He was treated at the scene , and the Team began evacuating him by stretcher towards Seathwaite.

This was in the same place as two recent incidents, on the main footpath from Swirls car park to Helvellyn summit in the area beside Brown Cove crags The Team immediately requested a winching helicopter in view of the likely seriousness of his injuries, and the Team members who were descending from the top of Nethermost were quickly on scene, along with three Patterdale team members. Other Team members were sent out from base to assist. A passing doctor also managed to get to the casualty quickly, but regrettably, the injuries the man had sustained were so serious that he didn’t survive. Rescue 199 from Prestwick attended the scene but was unable to winch in the very strong wind. The Team then stretchered the casualty down to Swirls car park to liaise with the police. Other Team members escorted the casualty’s partner down. Conditions in the valley give no clue to how difficult conditions will be at 800 metres. The Team cannot emphasise enough the serious challenge that the mountain poses in these winter conditions; snow patches have frozen to bullet hard ice, making crampons, and an ice axe to arrest any slip/fall absolutely essential. 22 Team members + 3 Patterdale MRT – 3 hours 9 minutes.",,helvellyn

He was stretchered back to the car park, and put into one of the Team’s Sprinters. As no ambulance was immediately available, the Team took him down to the Cottage Hospital to await an ambulance which would take him to Carlisle for further treatment. The Team returned to base.
Earlier in the day, they had been called to a group of young walkers caught in adverse weather on the top of Blencathra without the necessary navigation equipment. Their position was fixed by the use of SARLOC, the phone based GPS location system, and one of the Team’s controllers was able to instruct them over the phone as to a direction to walk; in a short space of time they had located the path down Scale Fell and were able to get themselves off the hill.
It’s maybe worth pointing out that the area where they were stuck was surrounded by steep drops. If they had not been able to make contact with the Team, the lack of a compass in the party could have led to serious consequences. Every year people die in mountains because of navigational errors – it’s worth learning the skill to avoid such a fate!",,latrigg

"106 A 39 year old female was reported as being crag fast in strong winds, she was unprepared for the conditions and too scared to move near the summit of Atkinson Pike, Blencathra. The team sent a Landrover to Mousethwaite Comb from where, along with more members who had gone direct, they ascended the mountain. Two team members climbed up Scales Fell and the rest went to Scales Tarn and beyond to approach from the Mungrisedale Common side to maximise the chances of finding the casualty. The lady was found hunkered down by the summit cairn on Atkinson Pike. A group shelter offered immediate respite from the wind, rain and hail showers. She was given warm clothes then helped down the mountain back to her car.

"A call came in via his friend of a 40 year man on his own who was lost and disorientated in worsening conditions after climbing to the top of Helvellyn via Striding Edge. Attempts to speak to the man on his phone were hindered by the very strong wind making communication impossible. Attempts to locate him by tracing the location of his mobile phone proved unsuccessful as his phone wasn’t set up to share location data. A team of five set off from base and quickly climbed to the summit from Swirls. Conditions from half way up the mountain were extreme, the local weather forecast was spot on, with 50-60mph winds and blowing snow making visibility very poor and with the very real risk of being blown over. Ice axes and crampons were essential for safe travel. The missing person was located sheltering behind the memorial at the top of Striding Edge.

"A call came in via Cumbria Police of a couple who were stuck on steep ground after wandering off-track between Seatoller car park and Castle Crag. Information was scant about the couple’s exact location with just a few clues such as ‘we can see white houses, a car park and a white van in a lay-by.’ A team of five set off in a Landrover pooling local knowledge on the drive up-valley trying to figure out the clues and the possible location of the stuck people. One further member went direct. A team of two were dropped off near Longthwaite YHA, a further two set off from Seatoller car park and the last two went back to explore above Rosthwaite, in theory covering all the steep ground around High Doat and Johnny Wood between Seatoller and Castle Crag. Further calls gained more clues including them being able to see ‘a cattle grid.’ There aren’t many cattle grids in Borrowdale, the only one in the area being on the road up Honister. A second team had already been despatched so they were tasked to search the slopes above the Honister road. The couple were indeed found above the cattle grid.

"Whilst returning down the valley from the Eagle Crag (callout 18) we got the call to go directly to the Gale Road on Latrigg to attend a mountain bike accident. A group on E-bikes were descending the track coming from the Glenderaterra Valley on the lower slopes of Lonscale Fell when one of them, a 65 year old man, fell off at high speed. Afterwards he said it was ironic having survived the earlier far more technical sections of path and fell on a relatively straightforward albeit fast section of flattish track. He tumbled onto his shoulder, side and head injuring his shoulder and ribs and he may have momentarily passed out. His recently bought helmet had significant scuffing on one side which undoubtedly prevented a serious head injury. His partner arrived on the scene shortly after and managed to apply a triangular bandage to support his arm for what was probably a broken collar bone.

A 27 year old woman taking part in a mountain marathon event slipped on wet rock descending Raise Beck from Grizedale Tarn. Reports initially suggested she had an ankle injury but was mobile and might just need walking off. A vehicle with 4 team members headed up to Dunmail raise and walked up to the casualty followed shortly after by 4 event marshals. It was quickly obvious that she was unable to walk and was splinted and given pain relief before being put on the stretcher. It was decided that the direct path down to Dunmail raise was too rocky and slippery so we crossed the beck and sledged the stretcher down through the grassy terrain of Willie Wife Moor.

A 65 year old male walker was descending Green Gable with a friend after a day out on the fells when he slipped on rocky ground falling awkwardly and injuring his knee. The team decided an approach from Honister Pass was the quickest using the steep mine track to get close to the Drum House with the Landrover and Sprinter. The team then set off on foot passing below Grey Knotts and Brandreth then up Green Gable to find the path descending into Gillercomb. On reaching the casualty he was assessed and given pain relief before being loaded onto a stretcher for a thankfully short carry down to the col between Base Brown and Green Gable.

The team were called and approached from Littletown in Newlands Valley to give the quickest route up to the top. The Great North Air Ambulance was also called to attend in case an urgent evacuation was required. By chance an English nurse and two visiting doctors from Holland were also walking on Catbells and were able to comfort the patient and look after him as best as they could without any medical equipment. On arrival the team gave support to the helpers already there with appropriate treatment. The air ambulance arrived shortly after and after a failed attempt to land on the summit due to the uneven nature of the top managed to put down on a flat part of the ridge just south of the summit.

"As usual on a Thursday evening the team were training in the base in Keswick, the night’s theme was a refresher session on rigging for rescue. During training one of a team of four gentlemen contacted the team from near Esk Hause in the central fells above Borrowdale as one of their party, a 53 year old man, had slipped and injured muscles in his thigh. They had pitched a tent for shelter and requested assistance as the casualty could not weight bear and had no chance of being able to get down by himself. We abandoned training, got dressed for the conditions and headed up Borrowdale. After such a long dry spell the weather was making up for it with driving rain and swollen streams. The team found the men above Esk Hause and while the team doctor assessed the casualty two team members accompanied the three uninjured men down towards Borrowdale. The casualty was ‘dressed’ in two casualty bags and a plastic bivvi bag to keep the rain off and strapped onto the stretcher. At 6 feet 3 inches the casualty was somewhat longer and heavier than the norm. This combined with the driving rain, the saturated ground and the length of the carry meant frequent stops were required to swap over the carrying team.

At midnight on Sunday Keswick team were called to assist the Cockermouth team in the search for a missing man who was reported as being exhausted after a failed ascent of Scafell Pike from Seathwaite in Borrowdale. The man had mistakenly descended to Wasdale and then climbed back up into the hills in order to return to Seathwaite. He lost his way on the Sty Head path and said he thinks he passed the night on the slopes of Great Gable from where he called for help. Unfortunately the signal was not strong enough to fix an accurate location before the battery died but placed him somewhere at the top of the Ennerdale Valley hence Cockermouth’s involvement. A small team from Keswick set off at half past midnight to cover the obvious descent paths back to Borrowdale from the Great Gable/Sty Head area. The weather was cool and dry but very windy. On our approach to Sty Head Tarn it seemed like it had started to rain but in fact it turned out to be spray being picked up off the tarn! The search along part of the Corridor Route and up Aaron Slack to Windy Gap proved fruitless although the man later said he had seen torches near Sty Head Pass but was unable to respond as he didn’t have a torch or whistle.

"A male and female both aged 30 became crag-fast on Great End. Without climbing equipment the couple believed they were scrambling up Custs Gully which is a steep and loose but relatively straightforward gully assuming you have a head for heights and the sure-footedness of a mountain goat. After further telephone conversations with the stuck pair it turned out they were actually in the left branch of Central Gully, a winter grade 3 ice climb and in summer a place any self-respecting mountain goat would avoid. The team approached from Seathwaite up Grains Ghyll then climbed up the east side of Great End to locate the top of the gully. Great care was required at the top due to the loose nature of the gully and the risk of sending rocks down on top of the couple below. After belays were set up one team member was lowered into the gully with additional harnesses and helmets for the pair who were then lowered to the scree at the foot of the gully where it was safe to un-rope and walk off. 22 team members – 4 hours 49 minutes",,great-end

"Two experienced climbers from southern Scotland crossed the border with a view to climbing Corvus on Raven Crag having seen that the forecast was better than at home. With rain forecast for the late afternoon they made steady progress up the climb. The rain started before they had completed the climb and whilst not technically difficult the route became slippery. The lead climber was on the top pitch and approximately 15m above the belay with no gear placed when he slipped and fell, bouncing down the rock and past the belay ledge to end up dangling on the rope some 30m below where he had fallen. The belayer lowered him a little until he was able to get back on the rock. The climber then managed to clamber his way back up to the belay ledge but was in pain and unable to continue. Fortunately there was a phone signal and they managed to call 999 and ask for Mountain Rescue. Keswick team responded quickly with two vehicles setting off into an increasingly wet Borrowdale. The team made their way to the top of Raven Crag where two members abseiled down to assess the casualty and package him up for evacuation. Because of the location and the distance the climber had fallen a request had been made for helicopter assistance. The local air ambulance responded very quickly landing in the valley to offer help when required. The coast guard helicopter arrived shortly after and attempted to approach for a crag pick off but the wind and conditions proved too dangerous to approach and they were forced to retreat. In anticipation of not being able to air lift the casualty more team members had been called to assist should a stretcher carry be required. Plan B was put into motion which involved a horizontal stretcher lift to the top of the climb followed by a rope-assisted clamber up the steep ground to the top of the crag from where it was possible to carry the casualty back down to the road and NWAS ambulance.

"An unusual 18 hours. Firstly at 18.15 the Isle of Man police alerted us that a group of walkers were in difficulty near Hard Knott pass. This was quickly passed on to the Duddon and Furness MR team who cover this area. Next at 01.30, two 25 year olds camping on Catbells suffered a tent collapse in strong winds. As they were uninjured they were coached over the phone to pack up the tent and descend on the same route as they walked up. At 09.32 Derwentwater Marina received a call from eight uninjured persons stranded on St Herbert’s Island after their inflatable boats were blown away during the night. A Keswick MR team member who works at the marina asked for team support to assist. Two boats were deployed to recover the stranded party and they were delivered to the lake shore close to their vehicles. Some time was then spent searching and recovering the missing boats. As things were drawing to a conclusion reports were received of two people stranded on Derwent Island. Their situation was checked but no assistance was required, and last but not least a pedalo abandoned on the shore, presumably due to the challenging conditions, was towed back to the marina. 5 team members – 2.5 hours",,st-herberts-island-derwent-water
The team received a call from the police regarding a man in his 60’s who had fallen and was dizzy. He was able to say that he was on Latrigg but was a little confused and unable to accurately describe his location. Two team vehicles were sent out – one to the top Latrigg carpark and one to go in from the bottom. After a search the man was found on the south western slopes below the seat near the top. He was assessed and it was considered that he may have had a stroke. An air ambulance was requested but none was available. The team drove a Land Rover as near as possible to the casualty location and after a short uphill stretcher lift transported him to a waiting road ambulance. 16 team members – 2 hours,,latrigg
"On a warm and partly sunny day a father and son were walking in the Newlands fells. Part way down the ridge of Hindscarth on the descent to Littletown, Newlands, the father collapsed. The son called 999 for help and started CPR. The Great North Air Ambulance responded very quickly and was able to land close to the casualty. They continued trying to resuscitate the man as members of Keswick MRT arrived. Unfortunately there was nothing that could be done to save him. Our deepest thoughts and sympathies go out to the man’s son who did everything possible to help his father, and to the rest of his family and friends. 20 team members – 2 hours 50 minutes",,hindscarth
"An adventurous 87 year old walker called 999 to say he was lost and on steep and tricky ground somewhere below Grange Fell in Borrowdale. The man was uninjured but had somehow lost the path and was descending cross country on very steep scree amongst dense trees. He was lucky enough to have mobile signal and plenty of battery on his phone so that contact could be maintained to try to ascertain his exact position. A small team was sent out to try to locate the man based on his clues: he could see glimpses of flat fields through the trees and the gable ends of some white houses looking west according to his compass. The description unfortunately fits most of the west-facing side of the Borrowdale valley from Lodore to Stonethwaite. We placed team members at intervals along this range and the man was instructed to blow his whistle in the hope one of the team would hear something. Nothing heard. The man continued his adventure downwards adding occasional additional clues until eventually we narrowed it down to Troutdale, the valley behind the Borrowdale Hotel. The team Landrover drove to the end of the track and as soon as we set off up valley a figure was spotted emerging from the trees at the side of the valley. The man was driven back to his car in Rosthwaite, extremely grateful, somewhat tired but none the worse for his wild adventure. 11 team members – 2 hours 30 minutes",,troutdale
A member of the public reported seeing a paraglider crash into the wooded area on the side of Latrigg. A team Land Rover was deployed with four members who searched the area. This was later supported by a Coast Guard helicopter who did several circuits but could not find the crash site. In this case it turned out to be a false alarm but with good intent. 6 team members – 3 hours 15 minutes  ,,latrigg
While a search for a potential crashed paraglider on Latrigg was concluding the police alerted us to a call from a walker who had slipped and badly injured his ankle close to the summit of Sail. The Coast Guard helicopter which was supporting the search on Latrigg was diverted to Sail and lowered the winch man to treat the casualty. The helicopter then returned to Crow Park in Keswick and picked up team members to help with the evacuation. The injured person was flown to the Cumberland Infirmary at Carlisle and the team members accompanied the casualty’s friend back to Braithwaite. Many thanks to Coast Guard Rescue 936 for their support. 12 team members – 3 hours 25 minutes,,sail
A group of walkers were descending the west side of High Rigg towards the Naddle valley when one of the ladies’ feet slipped into a hole and she heard a popping sound which was accompanied by immediate intense pain. Due to the poor mobile reception one of the men descended to the nearest house to call 999 and ask for Mountain Rescue. Once the exact location of the party had been established two vehicles were dispatched to Shaw Bank at the foot of High Rigg where they met with the informant The team proceeded up the hill through a dense jungle of chest-high bracken to the casualty’s location. The lady was given pain relief and her leg splinted before being stretchered down to the road where she was transferred to a waiting ambulance. We will now be checking ourselves for ticks! 13 team members – 2 hours,,high-rigg
"Keswick team were alerted to a missing 15 year old boy somewhere above the Langdale Valley but with the possibility that he may have strayed onto our patch at the top of Borrowdale. The boy had been walking with his family and aiming to descend back to Langdale from Stake Pass. It seems the boy who was wandering alone at the front missed the turn off and kept walking. His family on reaching the correct descent path searched for an hour before calling for rescue team help. Langdale and Ambleside started from their side whilst a sprinter full of Keswick team members drove to the campsite at Stonethwaite to help in the search. In pouring rain Keswick team split with half heading up Langstrath and the rest up Greenup Ghyll with a view to covering the paths at the top of each valley. We were very relieved to receive a stand down message shortly after setting off, the boy had been found descending Rossett Ghyll. 15 team members – 1 hour 30 minutes",,rossett-ghyll

One of those rare occasions when we are called to help a team member! A team member’s wife had gone over on her ankle while descending Ullock Pike and required assistance as she could not weight bear. Keswick were short on numbers given it was a bank holiday and called in assistance from Cockermouth MRT who responded with 5 team members.

"An instructor from a local outdoor adventure company called 999 and asked for Keswick Mountain Rescue to come to the assistance of a 61 year old man who had been ghyll scrambling in Stoneycroft Beck in Newlands. The normally fit and healthy man had a potentially serious medical condition.  A team Landrover with five members set off from base and a number of others went direct to the scene. On driving up the Stoneycroft track the Landrover slipped off the dirt road and rolled down the steep slope landing back on the Newlands road on its wheels. Fortunately, thanks to the design of the Landrover and its fitted roll cage, the five occupants escaped with relatively minor injuries. Meantime the team members who had gone direct along with a team paramedic and an emergency doctor were able to attend to the casualty who was assessed and evacuated back to the valley to be transported to hospital by air ambulance. The team Landrover performed faultlessly in protecting its occupants but was left in a rather bad state with all external equipment including a stretcher and telescopic radio mast destroyed. The equipment inside survived but the vehicle itself is beyond economic repair. This leaves the team short of one of it’s main response vehicles and the team compromised until a replacement can be sought as soon as possible. 18 team members – 2 hours 10 minutes",,stoneycroft-beck
"Shortly after returning to base and dealing with the loss of the Landrover, redistributing kit and making provisions as best as possible, the second callout came in. A couple were on Sharp Edge on Blencathra when part way along the traverse the lady became paralysed with fear and was unable to move. A small team left base and climbed quickly to Sharp Edge where a rope was set up, the lady helmeted and harnessed then assisted back up to the ridge and down the north side to what is known as the ‘Chicken Path’ then escorted down to safer ground. 9 team members – 2 hours 50 minutes",,sharp-edge-blencathra
"A man was walking a section of the Cumbria Way from Keswick to Caldbeck with his nine year old dog when after a long wet day the dog refused to carry on. They had just gone past Lingy hut en route towards High Pike in the Caldbeck Fells. The man attempted to carry to dog but it was too tiring and they were both getting cold so he returned to Lingy hut after calling 999 and asking for Mountain Rescue help. A small team drove to Mosedale mines from where they quickly climbed up to the hut where they found the man and his dog. With visions of Great Danes and Rottweilers and the possibility of having to call more team members to stretcher the dog off the team were pleased to find a small and easily portable cold, shivering terrier. The pair were escorted down to the track at Mosedale road end where one of the team members was able to drive the man and his dog to their accommodation in Caldbeck. 6 team members – 2 hours 10 minutes",,lingy-hut-mosedale
"Just like last week as team members were preparing to go to the base for the weekly training session we received a message from Cumbria Police of a 47 year old lady who had injured her ankle on returning from a walk up towards Scafell Pike. With the prospect of a reasonably long stretcher carry and no shortage of team members three vehicles set out in response. It was the first time we had used the borrowed Edale Mountain Rescue Land Rover (thanks again guys). On a beautiful warm late summer evening the team made their way up from Seathwaite towards Sty Head Pass where they found the casualty about 500m short of the tarn. The lady’s injury was assessed and after a box splint had been applied to stabilise her ankle she was assisted onto a stretcher for a carry back down to the valley. Whilst carrying the stretcher it is the responsibility of the front person to shout to warn the others about upcoming obstacles; large rocks, drainage ditches and the like. An unusual shout was heard twice on the descent of ‘FROG.’ No frogs (or toads) were harmed during this rescue. 23 team members – 2 hours 55 minutes",,sty-head-borrowdale
"A man in his 70s was descending the path from Dock Tarn to Stonethwaite but slipped and injured his thigh and elbow. He tried to continue but eventually had to stop as he was unable to weight bear. A couple on the same path came across the man but as the mobile signal in this part of Borrowdale is a problem they continued to Stonethwaite where they were able to call for assistance. Land Rover ‘Echo’ was dispatched and the man was quickly located above the tree line and treated for cuts and provided some pain relief. Whilst waiting for the stretcher crew to arrive in a second vehicle, the casualty wanted to try descending the rocky path with support from two team members. This was fortunate because as the man was assisted a report came through that a female had fallen and injured her ankle about 200m down the same path, and very near to the approaching stretcher team. This could be a Keswick MRT record in getting to a casualty! Both injured parties were helped to an awaiting ambulance who checked them over and took them to hospital at Whitehaven. 20 team members – 2 hours 50 minutes",,lingy-end-stonethwaite
A group were scrambling up Cust’s Gully on Great End when one of the party dislodged a boulder causing an injury to his knee. At this point the group had mobile reception and a call for help was made. Keswick MRT were alerted by the police but subsequent contact was difficult as they had unknowingly descended into a mobile blind spot. They had also indicated to the police that they may attempt a self rescue using equipment in the stretcher box at Sty Head. Their exact location was therefore unknown. With this in mind a couple of team members went up Styhead Gill to the stretcher box whilst the rest of the team made their way up Grains Gill. The casualty’s group were found in Ruddy Gill having made some progress in helping their friend down the path. After an examination the casualty was stretchered to Seathwaite and taken by the friends to hospital for further checks. 16 team members – 3 hours 40 minutes  ,,ruddy-gill-seathwaite-fell
"A group of 6 had been ghyll scrambling in Stoneycroft Beck in Newlands when one of the party, a 22 year old man, went over on his ankle and was unable to continue. A team Landrover with five members set off from base along with our Mercedes Sprinter meeting up with a further team member at the foot of the ghyll. There was some discussion about whether the Landrover should be driven up the track as this was the site of our other Landrover rolling just three weeks ago. In an effort to ‘exorcise’ a few demons, the Landrover proceeded up the track past the accident site and up to within a few metres of the casualty. The young man was assessed and splinted and then stretchered down to the road where he was taken by the group’s minibus to be checked at hospital.

A 13 year old boy was with his family on a guided trip up the via ferreta on Fleetwith Pike. On the final steep section he slipped and despite the safety system fell a short distance hurting his chest. The guide reported the incident and looked after the boy whilst the Keswick MR team was dispatched. On arrival some team members crossed the wire bridge to get to the casualty site whilst others made their way up to the exit of the via ferreta. The team doctor assessed the boy and provided some pain relief. In the meantime options for an extraction were considered. As there was loose rock in the vicinity it could have been risky to lower a stretcher from above so a coastguard helicopter was requested which flew in close and winched the boy up and then made their way to Carlisle hospital. It is understood the boy suffered some bruising to his ribs but is making a good recovery.

On their return they lost the path in the woods but could see on their mobile phone map that the car was almost straight above them. They attempted to climb up direct but found the ground increasingly steep and impossible to continue. The descent was now an unattractive proposition so they called 999 and asked for Mountain Rescue help. Some of the team members from the first callout went straight back out again and climbed up from near to Lodore Falls to locate the family under the crags below Surprise View. One team member took the young lad straight down whilst the rest of the team helped the two ladies securing them on a short rope on the steep, bouldery and slippery ground.

As a number of team members were in Scotland undertaking winter training, RAF Leeming, who were in the area, were asked to support Keswick MRT. Four from the RAF team made the ascent whilst the remainder were kept on standby at Mousethwaite Comb. The two walkers were rope assisted from the difficulties and were walked off the fell. The Keswick team members returning from the Cairngorms spotted MRT lights above Mousethwaite Comb and asked if further assistance was required, but fortunately, after a full day on the hill and a 4.5 hour drive, this offer was turned down. Many thanks to RAF Leeming, and the fell runner. 15 team members + 4 from RAF Leeming – 4 hours 40 minutes      ",,blencathra
"After climbing Blencathra from Mungrisedale a young man, after considering his options, decided to descend via Sharp Edge. The weather was cloudy with a fine drizzle falling and everything was slick with moisture. At the bottom of the steep initial descent and just at the start of the Sharp Edge traverse the man slipped on the extremely greasy rock and fell about 10ft bashing his shoulder and twisting his ankle. He had been carrying 2 ice axes and it was one of those that had stopped him falling further. In pain and somewhat shaken up he called 999 and asked for Mountain Rescue help. A team of five quickly set off from Keswick base in the Landrover shortly followed by a Sprinter with further team members in case the casualty needed to be stretchered down. The team made their way up Mousethwaite Comb, up past Scales Tarn and along Sharp Edge to find the casualty in good spirits but getting cold after his wait. The man was harnessed up and given a helmet before being rope-lowered down to awaiting team members on what is known as the Chicken Path from where he could be safely walked off. 12 team members – 3 hours 55 minutes",,sharp-edge-blencathra
A group of walkers were intending to walk from Thelkeld over the Dodds and along the ridge towards Helvellyn and camping near Red Tarn. Unfortunately the going was slow with bad weather and they got a soaking. An 11 year old in the group got particularly cold and as they found it difficult to warm him up got concerned about his well being. Whilst help was being requested they decided to pitch tents on the side of Stybarrow Dodd and got the boy out of wet clothes and into 2 sleeping bags with some warm food. By the time Keswick MRT arrived he had warmed up and with some dry clothes was able to walk down with the team from Sticks Pass down to Stanah. 17 team members – 4 hours 15 minutes  ,,stybarrow-dodd
"Whilst team members were making their way up Stybarrow Dodd on incident number 4 a second call came in from an injured walker on the path from Watendlath to Rosthwaite. It was initially reported that there had been a knee/hip injury but it transpired that the person had slipped, done the splits, and pulled a muscle. The party continued down and were met by Keswick MRT at the lower fell gate but did not require treatment or assistance. 10 team members – 1 hour 40 minutes  ",,rosthwaite
"A group was ascending Beckstones Gill on the side of Barf, when one of the the party experienced a supraventricular tachycardia attack which manifests itself as an extremely high heart rate. As a result the walker was unable to continue. By the time Keswick MRT arrived at the scene the heart rate had reduced and after a check over by the team doctor the casualty was able to walk accompanied down to the road. 24 team members – 1 hour 30 minutes      ",,beckstones-gill-powter-how
A young lady and her father were descending Barrow after having walked all the way around the Coledale Horseshoe when she went over on her ankle and heard/felt a popping sound. To have come so far and with the end in sight! They dialled 999 and asked for mountain rescue help. Two vehicles left the base and rushed to assist. After setting up a shelter against the very cold wind the team did an assessment before splinting the ankle and packaging her up for a stretcher carry. The lovely smooth grassy nature of the Barrow path meant that we were able to slide the stretcher on its skis the majority of the way down to the foot of the hill. The pair were then able to make their own way to Carlisle Infirmary for an x-ray. 17 team members – 1 hour 40 minutes,,barrow
Storm Ciara caused some very early morning chaos at the caravan park on Crow Park Road in Keswick. An evacuation of the site was commencing when the Police requested support from Keswick MRT. The initial task was clearing a narrow lane with a stalled camper van that was causing a blockage. We were then directed to a flooded area in the park to help people and dogs trapped in vehicles. During this time it was noticeable how the depth and strength of the flood water was increasing. Everyone was helped to safer areas but unfortunately some vehicles had to be abandoned. 12 team members – 2 hours 15 minutes,,keswick
A runner had stopped on his descent from Falcon Crag towards Ashness Bridge to enquire about someone who had slipped and fallen. Having established that the person was ok he continued his run. However after 100m the runner also slipped and sustained a nasty dislocated ankle. He was lucky to encounter some passing walkers including some doctors who provided initial support and made the call for help. The Keswick MR Team arrived soon after and administered some strong pain relief before reducing the ankle dislocation. After splinting the casualty was stretchered down to the awaiting ambulance at Ashness Bridge. 17 team members – 1 hour 49 minutes,,ashness-bridge

"Not long after returning to base after the first callout of the day we were alerted to the second. Not only was it on Castle Crag again but almost in exactly the same place. This time it was a lady who had been picked up off her feet by a gust of wind and unceremoniously dumped on her side injuring her shoulder. Most of the team members from the first callout plus a few more quickly re-packed the vehicles and set off back to Hollows Farm campsite and up the Allerdale Ramble to the back of Castle Crag. The casualty was assessed, pain relief given and then stretchered down to rendezvous with the NWAS ambulance in Grange for onward travel to hospital. 12 team members – 1 hour 50 minutes",,castle-crag
"In very changeable weather a couple were making their way down the Allerdale Ramble behind Castle Crag in Borrowdale when the lady went over hard on her ankle. She felt immediate pain and knew she had likely broken it. They called 999 and asked for Mountain Rescue help. Two vehicles left the base and drove down an incredibly watery Borrowdale Valley to Hollows Farm campsite where they raced up the track to the back of Castle Crag. Having been lying on the cold and wet ground and despite many layers having been placed around her the casualty was getting quite cold. On arrival the lady was given a heat blanket and wrapped in a warm casualty bag before being assessed. Some pain relief was given before splinting her lower leg. The casualty was then stretchered down, through crazy heavy hail showers, to the team vehicles from where she was transferred to a waiting NWAS ambulance in Grange for transport to hospital. 13 team members – 2 hours",,castle-crag
A 50 year old lady had slipped and injured her ankle beside the Glenderamackin River in the valley behind Souther Fell. Her walking companions provided a very accurate position with a grid reference and what3words location. Two Keswick MRT vehicles were dispatched and on arrival provided some pain relief and splinted the ankle. The casualty was stretchered to Mungrisedale and then taken by her friends to Carlisle hospital for further checks. 19 team members – 2 hours 25 minutes,,bannerdale
"Having waited for a good weather forecast, a group of 13 school pupils, accompanied by two adults, climbed to the top of Helvellyn from Thirlmere. Their route to the summit involved a lot of movement over snow slopes and they then returned ‘off piste’ down steep snow patches and by scrambling over rocky scree. Unfortunately, the slope they chose is convex and consequently steepens as you descend. Without crampons, or ice axes to arrest any fall, the group made their way downhill as best they could on the hard snow until one of the group slid out of control coming to rest some 60-80ft lower down, but not before hitting his face and breaking his nose along with breaking a couple of fingers. The group called 999 and asked for Mountain Rescue but could not give an exact location. The information given was that a member of the group had slid 50m and had sustained head injuries. Two vehicles left base and made their way to Swirls car park from where they started to climb towards Helvellyn knowing only that the missing party were somewhere between them and the summit. A Coast Guard helicopter was also called due to the potential seriousness of the incident. Control were later able to make further contact with the group and were then told that one of the party, on seeing the fall had run off down hill and had not been seen since. Further team members were subsequently tasked to find the missing person who was later found by police. It was now dark as team members approached the steep section of Brown Cove Crags. Voices were heard off to the right of the path on the slopes known as Helvellyn Screes and after donning crampons to negotiate the steep and hard snow slopes the team members found the group huddled in small groups on scree ledges. Whilst an assessment of the casualty was being carried out the rest of the team cut steps across the snow slope and escorted the cold, damp but uninjured pupils one by one to safer ground. Once the casualty had had his hand splinted and injuries assessed he was able to walk with assistance. With one team member on either side the casualty was walked off along with the rest of the group back to the main path. A reminder that despite that rare sun appearing in the sky, green fields and daffodils emerging down in the valleys the fells are in full winter condition and those venturing above the snow line should be suitably clothed, experienced and prepared. 22 team members – 4.3 hours",,helvellyn-14
A group were descending Brund Fell after completing an ecology field trip when one of the party had sudden stomach pains near the aptly named Resting Stone. These were so severe that it prevented further progress on their descent. After requesting help Keswick MRT sent a vehicle to Rosthwaite. Whilst team members were making their way up the fell a second vehicle was dispatched which was flagged down by part of the group who had arrived at the road at Frith Wood. A team paramedic from the second vehicle located the casualty and after a check up helped walk the casualty the short distance to the car park. 14 team members – 1 hour 8 minutes,,brund-fell-rosthwaite
Whilst walking in Dodd Wood an 83 year old man slipped and took a 20 foot tumble injuring his head and ribs. The North West Ambulance Service requested assistance in getting the casualty back down to the main road. The Keswick MRT Land Rover was dispatched and was able to park close to the injured man. After an initial assessment he was securely packaged and stretchered down to the road and the waiting ambulance. 11 team members – 1 hour 53 minutes,,dodd-wood
"A 27 year old cyclist was descending Honister Pass with his friend, on a dry and sunny day, when he lost control of the bike and fell suffering severe injuries. Two passing off-duty medics immediately provided assistance and in a short time Cumbria police, mountain rescue, and air ambulance teams arrived and tried to resusitate the casualty.

"A routine day at a farm ended tragically after a 52 year old farmer suffered serious injuries in an accident. His family and co-workers were nearby and did all they could with first aid until land and air ambulance crews arrived. As the accident occurred 200m up a fell additional support from Keswick MRT was requested. Several doctors, paramedics, and ambulance staff made a sustained effort but sadly could not save him. The man was an old school friend to a couple of team members who attended the call so it was a particularly poignant incident for Keswick MRT. Our deepest sympathies go out to the man’s family and friends.  ",,high-side
"The North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) alerted the team to help a cyclist who had crashed at the notorious bridge on the descent from Honister Pass towards Buttermere. Head injuries were reported and so a first vehicle was rapidly deployed. On arrival an assessment was made and although the cyclist was dazed there were no apparent significant injuries. Fortunately he was wearing a helmet. An ambulance soon arrived, and after a further check the cyclist able to walk to the ambulance which then transported him to hospital. 8 team members – 51 minutes",,honister-pass
"At the end of another hot day Cumbria Police alerted us to a man with a broken femur at Black Moss Pot in the Langstrath Valley. An injury of this nature is serious so there was a full team call out and helicopter assistance requested. To ensure sufficient social distancing between the team three vehicles were dispatched and several members went direct to Stonethwaite. Whilst en route to Black Moss Pot we could see the injured man had already walked, with assistance, around 1km. As a broken femur was unlikely the air ambulance was stood down. Some pain relief was provided before the man continued to walk to one of the Keswick vehicles, which then drove him a short distance to an ambulance waiting at Stonethwaite. 23 team members – 1 hour 49 minutes  ",,langstrath-valley
"A walker descending High Spy thought they heard shouts for help coming from the upper Newlands Valley. An emergency call from the walker was originally routed by the Police to Cockermouth MRT who re-directed it Keswick MRT. The timing of this coincided with our regular Thursday night training and so a small team was sent to investigate. A Land Rover made its way up the miners track, as far as possible, towards Dale Head. A search was then made of likely spots but nothing was found. 5 team members – 3 hours 9 minutes",,high-spy
"Early on Sunday morning a 19 year old had fallen and injured her ankle near to Sty Head pass. The group she was with attempted to help her down to Seathwaite but they realised this would not be possible and so called for help. Fortunately Wasdale MRT had set off for a training exercise and were relatively near to the casualty site. They immediately called off the training and went to assist. After the ankle was treated and pain relief provided the Wasdale team agreed to stretcher the casualty down towards Seathwaite for a handover with Keswick MRT near to Stockley Bridge. Keswick would then complete the carry. The Covid-19 threat means rescue teams protect themselves with PPE as seen in the photographs. Bear in mind that Sunday was a very hot and muggy day and so a long stretcher carry in PPE is particularly difficult. Our thanks go to the Wasdale team who, following the handover, had to ascend back over Sty Head to Wasdale. A sterling effort. 11 Keswick team members – 2 hours 43 minutes (Wasdale team – much longer!)  ",,sty-head
A 19 year old fell 8m whilst climbing the route M.G.C. at Shepherds Crag in Borrowdale. Unfortunately he hit the ground and was in and out of consciousness after a bang to the head. Due to the nature of the injury air and road ambulance teams attended and treated the casualty. Keswick MRT packaged the man in a vacuum mattress and stretchered him to a road ambulance which then took him to the Cumberland Infirmary at Carlisle. 24 hours later we received news that he had been discharged from hospital with “just” bruises to his shoulder and a cut to the head. He was remarkably lucky. The climber gave us permission to share the photo of his helmet and this may have saved his life or prevented a life changing injury. 16 team members – 1 hour 56 minutes,,shepherds-crag-borrowdale
"Two ladies in their twenties and a sprocker spaniel set off at 2pm from St John’s in the Vale Church to do a circular walk to take in a number of Wainwright listed fells starting with Clough Head. The women were experienced fell walkers and were well dressed for the pretty awful weather that was forecast. Armed with their guide book and phones they made steady progress but somehow missed their turn just after Stybarrow Dodd where they should have turned down to descend to the valley from Sticks Pass. They continued along the ridge in the cloud, rain and wind gradually becoming aware that they had gone too far. With phone batteries almost dead and darkness approaching they called 999 and asked for Mountain Rescue assistance. Using Phone Find the location of the women was established as the summit of Helvellyn. A small team was sent to find and escort the couple back to the valley.
It was a warm and wet walk up from Swirls until approaching the top of Brown Cove Crags where the wind increased dramatically and the temperature dropped. The women and dog were located at the summit shelter and were walked off the hill before being driven back to their vehicle. A reminder that even in mid summer the weather can be appalling on the tops. The women were prepared for the conditions but would have benefitted from a map, compass and head torches. 10 team members – 3 hour 30 minutes",,helvellyn
"Whilst part of the team were out in the Langstrath Valley dealing with incident no. 26, three more calls came in for assistance. One was relatively minor and was dealt with on the phone. Another incident was handed over to the Langdale Ambleside team as it overlapped their patch and we had few members left to attend as they had gone to our second callout of the evening: A 71 year old male had reached the top of Scafell Pike with 3 friends and whilst descending took a tumble and damaged his hip and ribs. He was able to descend some way down the Corridor Route back towards their starting point at Seathwaite but the pace was too slow and the pain too great to continue so they called 999 and asked for Mountain Rescue assistance. Fresh team members set off to locate and treat the casualty. They were followed shortly after by team members returning from the first callout of the evening. On reaching the casualty he was assessed and some pain relief was given before being loaded onto a stretcher for a carry down. In consideration of the remote location and the nature of the incident an air ambulance was called. A suitable flat landing spot was found above Sty Head Tarn and shortly thereafter a helicopter from the North West Air Ambulance arrived. A handover was done, the casualty loaded into the helicopter and then the helicopter took off to fly to Barrow Hospital.

The start of a full evening: Keswick team were alerted to a 17 year old female who had slipped and dislocated her knee in the lower part of Langstrath Valley in Borrowdale. She had been putting on a sock after a dip in the river when she overbalanced and fell awkwardly resulting in the knee cap dislocation. Two vehicles with team members left base and met up with the NWAS (North West Ambulance Service) crew and the father of the girl at Stonethwaite camp site from where they continued on foot up the valley. The NWAS paramedic assessed the casualty and pain relief was given before the knee cap was reduced (put back in place). She was then stretchered back to the camp site to the ambulance. The team had become aware of a second incident taking place so they immediately went on to assist. See next incident. 11 team members – 3 hours,,langstrath

After confirming the location as being close to a drive-able track one vehicle with 5 team members set off from base to assist. The man was assessed and given pain relief before being stretchered down to the vehicle and then taken down to rendezvous with an ambulance at Fellside Farm. It’s always good to hear back from casualties after a rescue and the man involved did just this after his release from hospital.

At 21.39 on Sunday a family of three called 999 requesting help after getting lost in cloud on the north west side of Scafell Pike. As this area is in the Wasdale MRT patch the police directed the call to them. At first light on Monday morning the Wasdale team requested support from Keswick MRT as part of a formal search of the central fells.

"Three pre-university school leavers had decided to climb the 3 peaks of Snowdon, Scafell and Ben Nevis. Having completed Snowdon without any trouble a couple of days ago the three young men had scheduled Scafell Pike, on their trip northwards, for today. Despite looking at the weather forecast and thinking it won’t be too bad, they set off in the rain from Seathwaite. They passed Sty Head Tarn and continued along the Corridor Route in strengthening winds and persistent rain. Their progress was becoming increasingly difficult due to the conditions and they started to get seriously cold, especially as one of the young men’s poncho had blown off in a strong gust. They realised they were potentially in danger and were concerned enough for their safety that they called 999 and asked for Mountain Rescue assistance. They retraced their route making it back to the stretcher box at Sty Head Pass, into which they all climbed and shivered to wait for rescue. They sent an accurate location from there using What3Words. Two well equipped walkers found them there and gave assistance with some spare clothing they had and encouragement to keep walking down in order to try to generate some warmth. One team member who lives in Seathwaite met them some way above the 1000ft boulder on the path to Sty Head. He was in the process of giving extra clothing, food and drink when the main rescue party arrived with further supplies. The three were walked back down to the valley and given a long lecture about mountain preparedness, weather and safety. The lads were humble, apologetic, receptive and have certainly learnt a lot from their experience. They promised to get things right for ‘the Ben.’ 13 team members – 2 hours 15 minutes",,sty-head
"Keswick team were requested to assist an ambulance crew with a lady who had damaged her ankle and was unable to weight bear after falling on the descent path from Helvellyn to Wythburn Church. Once again the use of what3words came in useful, on top of a grid reference, with a location of ///wipes.companies.elite. This 3-word reference pinpointed the casualty position on the intersection of the forest track and footpath which meant that we would be able to drive directly to the casualty. Just in case there was an error some of the team were dropped at the Wythburn Church car park to make their way up the path on foot.

Thursday evenings are team training nights and many team members were preparing or just about to eat their evening meals before going to the base for practice. Instead two vehicles left base and drove up the valley on the mine track to Force Crag. Team members continued on foot up what is known as the ‘Burma Road,’ named during the Second World War when it was used to transport barites from the upper mines. Being a nurse the casualty knew the benefits of the medical acronym RICE (rest, ice, compression and elevation) and was lying comfortably with her leg raised and supported. Pain relief was given and the ankle splinted before loading the woman onto a stretcher for the carry down to the vehicles at the mine.

A 60 year old male was cycling at speed down the main track from Force Crag mine towards Braithwaite when a sheep leapt out into his path causing him to crash. Although his helmet saved him from a significant head injury he still sustained severe facial and possible spinal injuries. A group of walkers were nearby and raised the alarm. One of the walkers was an A&E doctor who carried out a thorough assessment and made sure the spine was protected from movement. Keswick MRT were quickly on scene and the medical team provided first aid and pain relief. The casualty was placed in a vacuum mattress and stretchered to one of the team vehicles.

The family’s mobile phone battery had finally died after repeatedly trying to call for help when they lost the path and ended up bog-hopping around Greenup Edge.

"A family group of 6 people, some as young as 16 years old, hired bikes in Windermere with the intention of riding to Wasdale Head Inn to meet up with other family members. They did so against the advice of the bike shop owner who highlighted the weather conditions and terrain were unsuitable for the trip. They did not give a detailed route plan and had unsuitable clothing for the conditions and took minimal provisions. At 21.00 on 4th August, when they failed to arrive at the Wasdale Head, the concerned family member reported them overdue. Many attempts were made to contact members of the group by calling and messaging all of their six mobile phones. Repeated attempts were also made to locate the party by using the ‘phone-find’ technology used by MR teams. All with no success. Throughout the remainder of the evening the four team leaders from Wasdale, Keswick, Duddon and Furness and Langdale Ambleside teams discussed the incident in detail. The conclusion was, that given no route description, we would be looking for a needle in a haystack and that the party may well not be in the mountains at all. As such members from some of the teams drove the roads most likely to have been ridden by a cycle party with no success. At 01.30 the teams stood down and restarted the search at 07.00 to be informed by the police at 08.30 that the party had recently arrived at the Wasdale Head Inn after a very cold, wet and unpleasant night out. The party explained that they had indeed gone into the mountains from Langdale with a plan to cross via Esk Hause, Styhead and descend into Wasdale, however they had become lost at Esk Hause. They had pressed on with the bikes as far as the boulder fields of Broad Crag before abandoning the bikes and continuing onto the Corridor Route where they went to ground until first light.

"A 22 year old female had walked up Skelgill Bank, the first ‘summit’ of Catbells, from Hawes End. In windy and wet conditions on the descent she slipped and injured her ankle and was unable to continue so called for Mountain Rescue help. Two vehicles attended with team members initially climbing towards the main summit from Skelgill due to the casualty’s reported position as near the summit. A phone-find search revealed her true location below Skelgill Bank. The casualty was assessed, her ankle splinted and then she was loaded onto a stretcher for the carry down. To avoid the steep and rocky part of the path the team opted to descend the slightly less steep and grassy/bracken slopes on the east side. Ground anchors were placed and a rope was used to safeguard the descent to avoid what would have been a much quicker and less controlled sledge down in the event of team members slipping. On arrival at the bottom the casualty was transported to Keswick Cottage hospital to await an ambulance for onward travel to Carlisle Infirmary. 15 team members – 3 hours",,catbells
A 60 year old male climber on a route called ‘Gazebo’ on the south crag of Castle Rock of Triermain in the Thirlmere valley took a leader fall from about 40ft up. The rock protection the man had placed whilst climbing ripped out and he hit the ground before tumbling down the steep slope below coming to a stop when his rope came tight. His belayer secured him to a tree with the ropes to prevent further sliding down the slope before calling 999 and asking for mountain rescue and reporting head injuries. In light of the serious nature of the incident an air ambulance was immediately requested. A team Landrover with five team members quickly left the base followed shortly after by two more vehicles and other members going direct. Information was initially scant regarding the situation of the climber until one team member who lives locally reached the scene and was able to confirm location and to some degree his condition. A quick medical assessment was done and it was clear that the casualty needed to be moved away from the steep crumbling scree so that a proper assessment could be completed and any treatment given. After an awkward manoever involving many hands the man was placed on a vacuum mattress and carefully lifted up the slope. Once on a flatter and more stable surface team medics and the HEMS doctor from the air ambulance were able to further assess and treat the casualty. A Coast Guard helicopter had also been requested to assist in extraction of the casualty considering the awkwardness of his position and the seriousness of the injuries. Being very close to the base of the crag and a tree it was necessary to stretcher the man to a clearer position so he could be winched into the Coast Guard helicopter. He was then flown down to the air ambulance who then flew him to Preston Hospital. 25 team members – 3 hours,,castle-rock

An 18 year old male was walking through Stonethwaite campsite after an amble up the valley when he appeared to suffer a seizure. His friends called the emergency services and an ambulance was dispatched and made it to Stonethwaite hamlet but could not navigate the rough track to the campsite. Whilst continuing on foot the ambulance crew requested assistance from Keswick MRT. A vehicle was dispatched to the campsite and met a number of other team members who had travelled direct. The man’s condition also triggered a response from the Great North Air Ambulance (GNAAS) who landed in a nearby field. After an assessment by the medical teams the Keswick MRT Sprinter transported the casualty to the land ambulance who then took the man to the Cumberland Infirmary at Carlisle. 19 team members responded (not all attended) – 1 hour 40 minutes  ,,stonethwaite

A couple of friends were mountain biking the ‘Borrowdale Bash’ circuit around the valley. On a fairly innocuous part of the track above Seatoller one of the riders front wheel slipped on some wet rock and he went over the handle bars. The crash caused a deep cut to his knee and was bad enough that help was needed. The uninjured rider was searching for phone signal to call the emergency services and met the Keswick MRT team leader who just happened to be in the area. Team members made their way to the casualty site and after treatment stretchered the man to the MR vehicles parked half way up Honister Pass.

"Two men were descending below The Band on Great End, above Sprinkling Tarn, when one of them had a nasty tumble amongst the sharp and loose boulders resulting in a deep laceration to his calf. Fortunately the pair who had camped out on Esk Hause the previous night were very well prepared and his mate did a good job of dressing and bandaging the injury with their own first aid kit. His friend helped make the casualty as comfortable as possible with his injured leg elevated to help reduce pain and swelling. They were then able to call 999 and ask for Mountain Rescue assistance. With Keswick team members low in numbers Cockermouth team were asked to help out due to the anticipated long carry out. When enough team members were present the man was loaded onto a stretcher and carried down the scree slope, initially with the help of a safety back rope due to the steep and rough ground. It was then a case of doing shifts on the stretcher for the long carry back to Seathwaite via Sty Head. We were extremely grateful for the help of the 7 Cockermouth team members, thanks guys.

"A 47 year old woman was descending Scafell Pike to Seathwaite with her husband. On reaching a point near Lingmell Col she slipped and twisted her knee causing some soft tissue damage. Unable to weight bear and walk any further they called for assistance. Normally incidents in this area would be dealt with by the Wasdale team but as they were committed to another job they requested help from Keswick. Two vehicles were initially sent to Seathwaite in Borrowdale, and as this could be a potentially very long stretcher carry a third vehicle was also dispatched. By this time the forecast drizzle had arrived with strong winds on the summits. As the team made the long march up the Corridor Route requests were made for Coastguard helicopter support. However due to the conditions this was not possible. The casualty was eventually located and treated and stretcher options evaluated. The Duddon and Furness team were at Wasdale Head in support of the Wasdale team. They agreed to make the ascent up Lingmell and meet the Keswick team who would start the descent. After jointly negotiating some steep scree with a back rope the handover was made and the Duddon team continued the descent down Lingmell nose into Wasdale, while the Keswick team retuned back down the Corridor Route in darkness to Seathwaite. 19 Keswick team members – 7 hours 30 minutes. 8 Duddon & Furness and 2 Wasdale team members  ",,lingmell-col
"On an uncharacteristically wild day a member of the public called 999 to report two adult males swimming in the lake after having capsized their canoe between St Herbert’s and Rampsholm Islands on Derwentwater. The two drifted fast downwind in the gale force winds and large waves and eventually ended up washed up on Lord’s Island. A Keswick MRT member who works at Derwentwater Marina took a rescue boat direct to the island to pick up the casualties and bring them to shore at Stable Hills. Meantime further resources were deployed from KMRT, Police, Fire and NWAS in case they were needed. Besides being a little chilly after a long swim the casualties were unharmed. 13 team members – 1 hour 22 minutes",,lords-island-derwentwater
"A couple were heading out on a walk from Honister towards Great Gable but as they were ascending the wind was becoming more ferocious. At a point near Brandreth they decided the wind was too strong and they started a retreat back down the hill. Shortly after starting the descent one of the party was blown off her feet and injured her hip and head on some rocks. A call for help was routed through to the Cockermouth team who asked Keswick to support with a stretcher carry. The Coastguard helicopter who attended the earlier lake incident (no.49) went to investigate a possible landing near to the casualty but with low cloud and a strong, gusty wind had to abandon the attempt. Both teams parked on the mine track above Honister and made their way in difficult conditions to the casualty site near to a group of tarns on Gillercomb Head. The casualty was dressed for the conditions, but was getting colder. A storm shelter was used as protection whilst the casualty was treated and pain relief provided. She was then packaged on a stretcher ready for the evacuation. Although returning back to the Honister mine was a shorter route it would have been hazardous due to the strong gusts. A decision was therefore made to sledge the stretcher down some grassy slopes into Gillercomb, and out of the wind. From Gillercomb there was a tricky descent down the path next to Sourmilk Gill to Seathwaite in Borrowdale. Much muscle was involved in manhandling the stretcher down awkward rocky steps but eventually the team made the handover to the ambulance at Seathwaite. 16 Keswick team members – 6 hours 11 minutes.",,brandreth

"The team were called by Patterdale MRT who had been contacted by the Police after a walker reported she and her brother had become separated whilst on Helvellyn. She had returned to their departure point at Swirls car park but had become concerned when he failed to appear. Given it was on the western side of Helvellyn it was felt this was a job for Keswick and because of difficulties in contacting the informant, due to poor phone signal, one team member was asked to meet her and glean further information. As this was happening further information came in to say the missing man had suffered a tumble and sustained cuts and grazes but was making slow progress down. Using the PhoneFind location software we could monitor his progress down, but given the update about possible injuries a further two team members drove out to assist.

During a walk from Stonethwaite in Borrowdale towards Dock Tarn a 65 year old man started feeling unwell. The man’s brother climbed up further to find a mobile signal to call 999 for help. Keswick team deployed to Watendlath due to the grid reference on the side of Dock Tarn that was given. Because of the nature of the reported symptoms and the man’s medical history the air ambulance was also called and reached Dock Tarn as the first members were arriving on scene. Despite an aerial and ground search around the given grid reference no sign of the casualty could be found. Some other walkers had seen the man and reported his position as just above the tree line on the Dock Tarn to Stonethwaite path.

"A couple on their second date decided to climb Sharp Edge on Blencathra. In slippery conditions part way along they wisely opted out of continuing along the ridge but unfortunately tried to descend from the ridge down towards Scales Tarn. The man slipped and fell from part way down. Instinctively he put his arms out to try to avoid tumbling and ended up sliding fast and bumping down the steep rocky slope until he came to rest on a ledge some 60m further down. His partner was then stuck on the crag unable to go up or down. Keswick team responded approaching from below Mousethwaite Combe and requested air ambulance and Coast Guard helicopter assistance. On their arrival weather conditions meant neither helicopter was able to assist directly with the rescue. Team members were split into two parties with a hasty team going to assist the fallen man approaching from the tarn, the second party climbed up to and along Sharp Edge in order to get to and lower the woman to safety. Many thanks to the passer by who had gone to the man’s assistance and given him extra clothing to wear whilst waiting for the rescue team, the man’s torch light was very useful to locate the casualty. On arrival a group shelter was used to protect the casualty against the increasingly inclement weather. Heat blankets were used to keep the casualty warm whilst he was being assessed prior to evacuation. The man’s successful attempts to not tumble in order to avoid potentially far more serious injuries meant that all the impact had been on his lower back, ribs and leg. Strong analgesia was given before immobilising him in a vacuum mattress and placing him on a stretcher for a rope-assisted lower down the mountain. Meantime other team members had climbed along Sharp Edge securing a safety line along the ridge. A belay was set up and a team member lowered to locate and secure the crag-fast female.

The man heard and felt a crack in his ankle as he landed and was in great pain and unable to move. A passing cyclist raised the alarm by calling 999 and asking for Mountain Rescue. As the callout was very close to the road the team sent one vehicle with more team members standing by should they be required.

Deciding not to attempt going up into steeper terrain and concerned about descending he made a wise decision to call for help. Several team members attended and were able to rope assist him down to the base of the hill.

"After a day in the fells a man was descending from Eagle Crag when he slipped and fell on steep ground. The man suffered multiple injuries including a broken upper arm, lower leg and broken ribs. Being a long way from the beaten path his whistles went unheard so, as he said, in the spirit of the late Doug Scott and his epic descent of the Ogre he spent the next 3-4 hours crawling very painfully down the slope. Eventually he reached the lower slopes of Greenup Ghyll and was spotted by walkers from the path on the other side of the stream. Two of their party ran down the valley to Stonethwaite and alerted the rescue services whilst another stayed with the casualty bandaging his broken leg and offering reassurance. An air ambulance had been requested but when the situation became clearer; the location and the extent of the man’s possible injuries this was stood down and the Cast Guard requested for a likely winch evacuation. The man was assessed by a team doctor and given strong analgesia before he was put onto a stretcher to await the Coast Guard helicopter. Fortunately there was a large enough low angle area close by that the helicopter was able to land light (still under power so as not to sink into the soft ground) to enable the man to be loaded for onward transport to hospital. 21 team members – 3 hour 38 minutes",,eagle-crag
"A couple came across a lone walker who had slipped and suffered a suspected ankle fracture. They managed to contact the police, asked for mountain rescue, and provided a What3Words location. They then stayed with the casualty until the rescue team arrived. For some unknown reason the W3W reference positioned the casualty close to the A66 near Braithwaite. Fortunately PhoneFind technology was used and a grid reference confirmed the location as on a path between Green Gable and Base Brown – many miles from the A66! Team vehicles set off for the Drum House above Honister pass, and from here the team made their way on foot contouring around Brandreth and over Gillercomb Head towards Base Brown. After providing pain relief and strapping the ankle the casualty was stretchered down Gillercomb and then down the rocky path next to Sour Milk Gill to Seathwaite.

"The team were called to help the ambulance service with a mountain biker who had come off his bike and suffered a painful knee dislocation. After some pain relief and treatment for cuts the casualty was stretchered a short distance to an ambulance. Although this was a relatively straight forward call out, rescue efficiency is almost always dependent on the teamwork between the control room at base and those on the hill. In control, members try to speak to and pin point the location of casualties and informants, manage communication with the team and third party organisations, ensure further support is provided if required, and log activity. It’s definitely the best place to be when it’s grim outside! We hope the casualty is back on his bike soon. 8 team members – 1 hour 14 minutes",,whinlatter

The team arrived and from the bottom located the casualty high up between Little Stanger Gill and Broad Haystack thanks to another passer by who had climbed up to investigate and then made themselves visible to the team. The approach from below was very steep and mostly composed of loose boulders hidden below waist-high bracken. The initial shouts for help were made by a 51 year old male who had witnessed his dog fall from a cliff and in his haste to reach him had fallen himself some considerable height sustaining serious injuries. As the team arrived the man was more concerned for his dog than himself. One of the team’s dog handlers assessed the dog whilst the man himself was being examined. Whilst the man was being given analgesia and treatment his 12 year old dog was placed in one of the equipment bags to be carried down for a visit to the local vet. Due to the very steep, loose and potentially hazardous terrain for a stretcher lower/carry a coast guard helicopter was requested. Even when the helicopter arrived it was not a straight forward winch operation due to the tight and steep location and the fact there was very little wind, helicopters like wind. The casualty was finally winched up and flown to the RVI in Newcastle for treatment. Many thanks to the highly skilled Coast Guard helicopter crew for their help in a tricky location and to the local female who had climbed up to investigate the calls for help and stayed with the casualty until rescue arrived.

On a beautiful clear night a small team set off along with two search dog handlers to search the immediate areas of the likely planned camp area including the woodland, village, campsite and up and around Fairy Glen. Once the requested search task was completed the team returned to base. With no subsequent tasking from the police the next day the incident was closed. 7 team members – 2 hours 42 mins",,langstrath
A 58 year old female lost her balance after being bumped into by a playful group of dogs on the stream-side path below Watendlath. The resultant slip on wet rock led to a hip injury severe enough to prevent her continuing. The husband had to walk to Watendlath to get a mobile signal from where he was able to call for Mountain Rescue help. Two vehicles left base and made their way towards Watendlath. As the exact casualty location was not known teams approached from below and above quickly locating the casualty approximately 500m below Watendlath. Analgesia was given to relieve pain before stretchering the female across the river to a team vehicle. The casualty was then taken to Keswick Cottage hospital to rendezvous with an ambulance that would take her to Carlisle Infirmary for an x-ray. 11 team members – 2 hours 39 mins,,watendlath

This was in an area with no mobile reception but a passing walker descended to the valley floor and raised the alarm. By the time Keswick Team arrived the man was very cold despite good winter walking clothing. An inspection of the ankle revealed a very bad break requiring a rapid evacuation and so CoastGuard helicopter support was requested. Unfortunately cloud cover at the casualty site meant the man, after pain relief and packaging with heat blankets, had to be stretchered down to an area with good visibility for a helicopter winch.

"A couple had just started the descent in their car of Newlands Pass (Buttermere side) when they hit black ice and skidded towards the edge of the road overlooking a steep sided valley. After recovering from this shock they were unable to continue as a number of other vehicles had been abandoned, and one in particular had blocked the road completely. They were unable to reverse due to the ice and as they were not dressed for the cold temperature they eventually called the Police for a rescue.

"A party of 3 had walked from Keswick over Jenkin Hill then Little Man on Skiddaw with the intention of going to the top of Skiddaw. As they gained height the wind increased and the ground got increasingly snowy which alongside the often driving rain, sleet and snow made for some very cold conditions. After going over Little Man the party decided to bid a hasty retreat down the slopes towards Slades Beck to pick up the path coming down from Carlside to Millbeck. The female by this stage was really struggling with the cold and her legs were buckling under her. By the time they got down to Slades Beck her legs were so cold she could no longer continue so they called for mountain rescue help. Members of Keswick team met up with RAF Mountain Rescue team members who were training in the area and made their way up to the casualty. On arrival the team found the casualty on very steep ground above the beck, she was in a survival bag and being prevented from sliding down the slushy slope by one of their group. A group shelter was erected and the female slowly warmed and given warm dry clothes. A stretcher rescue would have been next to impossible in the steep-sided stream valley so fortunately for everyone the female was eventually able to stand and start to make progress down protected by a rope and supporting team members.

The team were alerted by the police of an ’emergency’ at the south end of High Rigg between St John’s in the Vale and the Naddle valleys. Unfortunately mobile reception was bad and no more details could be ascertained. Keswick sent 3 vehicles with team members with others going direct to initially search the location from where the 999 call had been made then the rest of the south end area of High Rigg. The night was mild and dry with good visibility. At 23:30 following discussion with the police the search was called off due to lack of information. The full story emerged the next day: a couple had broken down in a very precarious position and the man had to climb to the top of Wren Crag before he got a phone signal from where he called the police but then almost immediately got cut off. Repeated attempts failed until his phone battery died. He had meantime managed to get hold of the RAC who came to their rescue. One very useful tool in the case of poor reception is the emergencySMS text service which will get through much easier than a call. To use this service you need to register your mobile first.

"Having summited Blencathra in poor conditions, an experienced walker lost his path in the cloud. He descended towards Sharp Edge, but didn’t like the look of it in the conditions opting instead for what he hoped would be a safer option – a grassy gully. After a few steps he slipped and slid a short distance. He was now on his back on scree in a gully that feeds into “The Usual Gully” – the scene of many incidents. Thankfully, he didn’t try to extricate himself from this position so he called for Mountain Rescue assistance. The man was able to give us an accurate grid reference using the free phone App OSLocate. Laying in the gully, he soon started to cool down but had packed a foil bivi bag.
On arrival the team set up a rope system on Sharp Edge and lowered a team member down the gully. After putting on a helmet and harness the two were lowered to safer ground below where they were met by members of Penrith MR Team who had been asked to assist.
Penrith MRT then walked the casualty down to Mousthwaite Comb from where one of the Penrith Team kindly offered him a lift to his car at Mungrisdale.

"In the early hours of the morning two men were heading along the Corridor Route (Sty Head Pass to Scafell Pike) to set up a safety rope on Broad Stand above Mickledore, Scafell, for a Bob Graham Round runner. One of the men tripped and fell on a tricky step sustaining head injuries. After some time and a check over from his mate, they deemed the injuries serious enough to warrant calling 999 and asking for Mountain Rescue help. The two started to make their way down towards Seathwaite. On receiving the callout a team member who lives in the valley quickly made his way up towards Sty Head Tarn somehow missing the two men. The next team member to arrive at Seathwaite found the casualty and his mate who had made it down to the valley.

"Just before Keswick team’s scheduled weekly training evening we received a callout from a fell runner reporting his companion had a ‘delirious episode’ whilst descending Hall’s Fell on Blencathra and was unable to continue down to the valley. With no mobile phone, he left his companion in a bivi bag in order to descend to summon help. Keswick team responded quickly, climbed up to the casualty, assessed and provided medical attention. A Coast Guard helicopter was requested for speed due to likely risk of hypothermia. Many thanks to Rescue 936 from Caernarfon who attended and winched the casualty from the ridge for onward transport to hospital. Many thanks also to Penrith MRT for responding in support. 24 Keswick team members, 2 Penrith MRT – 3 hours 8 minutes  POST SCRIPT – You only live twice Mr Bond! We are absolutely delighted to be able to give the full story of Keswick’s second callout of the year on the 6th of January on Hall’s Fell, Blencathra. The initial incident report was kept deliberately scant of detail as at that stage nobody knew what the outcome would be. Here is the story: The team were called to a 26 year old fell runner who, near the end of leg one of a Bob Graham Round training run, was unable to continue the relatively short remaining descent down Hall’s Fell to Threlkeld village. The temperature all day had been around freezing point with strong winds, snow and sleet showers. His friend helped him into an emergency survival bag before he ran down to raise the alarm.  Two team members formed an advance party and went to investigate armed with warm clothes and snacks to deal with what was expected to be a hypoglycaemic (low blood sugar) and cold fell runner. Around 20 minutes up Hall’s Fell the two discovered the survival bag empty but folded up with stones piled on top, and no casualty in sight. They continued on and discovered the casualty a little further up the trail lying face down and with no signs of life. Despite the fact that to all appearances the man was lifeless, current medical guidelines and our team training tells us that a casualty is not dead until they are warm and dead. To that end the casualty is treated as if he were still alive. Whilst one team member started an assessment of the casualty the other reported the situation by radio and the urgent requirement for a helicopter evacuation. When the initial careful assessment showed no signs of life CPR was commenced with the two team members rotating at regular intervals to maintain good chest compressions. A few minutes later the medical bag with defibrillator arrived on scene. The pads were placed on the man’s chest and shocks given but with no effect. As more team members, and reassuringly one of the team’s doctors, arrived with various bits of kit the man’s evacuation plan was put into action, all the time with CPR in progress. An autopulse is a battery-powered machine that performs chest compressions allowing the casualty to be transported on a stretcher. When this arrived on scene the man was loaded onto the stretcher in preparation for the arrival of Coast Guard Rescue 936 helicopter arriving from Caernarfon. In very blustery and showery conditions the man was expertly winched from Hall’s Fell ridge into the helicopter along with a team doctor who accompanied the casualty to A&E at the RVI Hospital in Newcastle.  On arrival at hospital the casualty’s core temperature was found to be 18.8 degrees. A specialist ECMO team arrived from the Freeman Hospital to ‘plug’ the casualty into an ECMO machine. This is a device that removes blood from the patient, warms and oxygenates it before circulating the blood back into the body. In this way the casualty’s body was re-warmed gradually.  There followed a number of very tense days with the casualty in an induced coma. Snippets of positive news received from the consultants in the hospital on the man’s progress were greeted with amazement from those who had seen him on the hill, incredulous that he could possibly be alive. After 5 days the man ‘woke up’ and was asking what on earth had happened as well wanting a coke! Five months on and the man who miraculously cheated death is making a very good recovery and has even managed some decent runs. This was one of the lowest body temperatures from which someone has survived – a truly remarkable survival story and a testament to the professionalism of all involved. It is normal for fell runners to travel light, rapid movement creates heat that doesn’t need much in the way of clothing – this is fine when things go right. Let’s hope the story of our survivor is a wake up call for those who venture ‘lightweight’ into the hills. Spare clothing and a survival bag doesn’t weigh much but could make the difference between life and death.",,halls-fell-blencathra

An 83 year old female collapsed in Crow Park. The informant gave the 999 call handler a What3Words location which was close to Hawes End. The team sent a Landrover first truck to the location only to find nobody. Further enquiries revealed the true location within walking distance of the base. Fortunately more team members had arrived at base and were able to respond quickly to this potentially serious medical incident. The casualty was assessed and stretchered back to base for further assessment and to await the arrival of an ambulance. This is the second callout in 3 days (and there have been others) when the W3W location has been close enough to be believable but wrong enough to be useless. W3W should not be relied upon on its own.

"A man in his late 70s was rock climbing with friends on a beautiful warm sunny day, clipping bolts in Bram Crag Quarry. On their third climb of the day the belayer on the ground suddenly felt a weight come onto the rope as, without warning, the man collapsed unconscious.

They corrected their mistake by climbing back out but again got a bit lost not far from Sty Head Pass. One of the party suffered a panic attack on the steep ground so, despite being well equipped with clothing and head torches, they thought it best to get help by calling 999 and asking for Mountain Rescue.

"At almost the summit of Causey Pike a woman suffered a probable lower leg fracture. A strong gust of wind caused her to be blown sideways but her trekking pole, got in the way of a stabilising leg movement and caused her to trip over it. The resulting injury was very painful. Keswick MRT deployed and shortly after Helimed 58 launched but could not land due to the strong wind. On arrival at the summit Keswick team provided strong pain relief, splinted and packaged her on a stretcher. She was then sledged and carried down the side of Causey Pike to an ambulance at Uzzicar. 21 team members – 3 hours 49 minutes  ",,causey-pike

"A group of six were descending Hind Gill above Seathwaite when one slipped and injured an ankle. As Keswick team were making their way up the steep path next to the gill Helimed 08 appeared but could not make a safe landing near to the casualty site and so returned to base. Once Keswick team reached the casualty the injured man was assessed, ankle splinted and packaged onto a stretcher. Due to a difficult and potentially dangerous stretcher carry down Hind Gill, or a long uphill haul a request was made for a winching helicopter. Whilst waiting for the helicopter the team were joined by three members of the RAF MRT and together the stretcher was dragged/carried a short distance up hill to a better landing area for the Coast Guard helicopter. The casualty was then airlifted to Seathwaite and taken by team vehicle to Longthwaite YH where he is staying, for onward transfer to hospital with his friends. 19 team members – 4 hours",,seathwaite
