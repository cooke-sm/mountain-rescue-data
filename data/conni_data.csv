"Each year we are asked to marshall this annual trail race. The course covers an area around Coppermines Valley, Torver, and returns to the village via the lakeshore. Runners from all over the UK compete.Today there were several injuries ranging from a possible arm fracture, head and leg lacerations and cramps. Members of the team helped where they could, but mainly it was ferrying the casualties to the event field. Only 1 person was taken to hospital with an arm injury.It was a good event helped by perfect weather conditions. However the ground underfoot was very slippy which could be a little hazardous at certain points along the route.",Coniston area,2012,6,October,38,NA,NA
"We became Knights of the Road again this Friday evening.This call out was originally allocated to the Langdale & Ambleside MR Team. However, they were having their Xmas dinner and asked us to attend. Ever obliging of course we did.A husband and wife, with their young son, were trying to negotiate Wrynose Pass in their vehicle. Unfortunately towards the top of the Pass, black ice caused them to lose their grip and the car was simply going nowhere.Two of our landrovers drove to the stranded family. Indeed it was very icy underfoot. The mother and son were carefully transferred to one of our vehicles for warmth whilst we assisted in getting the car safely back into driveable mode.We escorted the family back down to Elterwater and gave them directions to their destination in Eskdale. It was a long way round, but a safe one.The call out took 1 1/2 hours.

"We returned to Grizedale Forest this Saturday to attend to another mountain biker.He was cycling the Fox Trail when the slippy surface caused him to come off his bike. The young man sustained a lower leg laceration which was very painful. Once he had been given pain relief he was put onto a stretcher and taken to the waiting helicopter. The Great North Air Ambulance then took him to Lancaster Royal Infirmary.The call out took 2 hours and 10 members were deployed.The team has now attended over 50 incidents this year, well above last year’s figure…and there is still the rest of the month to go with lots of snow and ice forecast….perfect conditions for would be casualties!!raw",Grizedale Forest,2012,1,December,51,NA,NA
Today the team was called out to the aid of a female walker.She had been walking on the track between Goatswater and Walna Scar when a strong gust of wind blew her over. She sustained an injury to her ribs and was in a lot of pain. Fortunately the Air Ambulance was able to attend and take her to Furness General.The team took the rest of the walking party back to the Rescue Base.The call out took under 1 1/2 hours due to the locality and helicopter evacuation. This was good because we seem to be spending a lot of time on call outs these last couple of months and have well exceeded last year’s turn out figure.,Goatswater Track,2012,25,November,50,NA,NA
"A mountain biker was cycling along the North Face Trail in the forest when he came off his bike, probably due to the slippy boarding.He sustained a possible fracture to his leg and an injury to his knee. He was in a lot of pain and was therefore given strong pain relief. The leg was splinted and the casualty was then stretchered to the waiting ambulance.10 team members attended this call out which took 2 hours.",Grizedale Forest,2012,20,November,49,NA,NA
The team was called out to a gentleman who had collapsed on Brown Pike whilst out walking.Two team members were already walking in the area and therefore went ahead to the casualty. The Great North Air Ambulance however had been able to land fairly close by and two paramedics were already in attendance.Sadly this gentleman passed away at the scene. Once the rest of the team arrived he was stretchered off the fell and taken back to the rescue base. The protocol for a fatality was adhered to.Our thoughts are with the man’s family.,Brown Pike,2012,18,November,48,NA,NA
The team was called to assist a father and daughter who had become lost in thick mist on Coniston Old Man.Fortunately the team leader was able to ascertain over the phone where they were and talk them safely off the mountain. This meant that a full team deployment was not required.,Coniston Old Man,2012,16,November,47,NA,NA
The Ambulance Service called for our assistance to help a lady who had blacked out and fallen.She was on her way to walk round the lake when she became unwell. She sustained a possible fractured wrist and facial injuries. Fortunately she was very close to a road so access was not the difficulty originally perceived.Her wrist was splinted before being taken to Furness General Hospital.,Coniston,2012,12,November,46,NA,NA
"A climber became cragfast in the South Rake Gully on Dow Crag.13 team members attended this incident. Three rope pitches were used to get to the climber. He was then brought down to safety, cold but unhurt.Due to his location and the complication of snow on the ground the rescue took some 5 hours.",Dow Crag,2012,5,November,45,NA,NA
"The call came as a couple being lost on Wetherlam. It was a beautiful afternoon and the felltops were covered in snow. The tracks on the summit of Wetherlam would have been difficult to follow.However, after talking to the couple by mobile phone, it was ascertained that they were much lower down. Although they had been nervous to carry on since the way down seemed very steep, they were in fact not far from a good path in the Yewdale Fells.The couple were soon located and accompanied to safety.16 team members were deployed initially and the rescue took 2 hours.",Yewdale Fells,2012,4,November,44,NA,NA
Today we assisted the North West Air Ambulance with the evacuation of a male casualty.He had slipped and injured his ankle. The team stretchered the gentleman to the helicopter which took him to Furness General Hospital.,Claife Heights,2012,1,November,43,NA,NA
"A couple became lost whilst they were walking along the Coniston Old Man ridge. As visibility was poor due to mist and oncoming darkness, they asked for help.We split up into three teams approaching the ridge from different routes. One team was tasked with searching the area around Swirl Howe and Great Carr, one ascended the ridge via Goatshause, and the other started from the quarries. One of our team members also brought her dog, a trained SARDA dog.We did have a Grid Reference and then a mobile phone photo of the area the couple said they were. Obviously this was a great help even if this did not seem to tie up with the information that they were on or near the ridge.Progress was hampered by high winds, mist and darkness, and the odd rain shower didn’t help as the going underfoot was already slippy. Eventually, shouts were heard and then a torchlight seen. The man and woman were found on a track which leads to Grey Friar, another fell in this range. The area is known as Fairfield. There was relief all round as this was not a good night to be out.The party descended safely via Prison Band to Levers Water where the landrover was waiting. Back at the base the couple were given a hot drink before they left. The team made their way to a local pub where chips and drinks were on offer….most welcome.The call out took 5 hours.",Swirl Howe / Grey Friar,2012,30,October,42,NA,NA
Well we became “Knights in Shining Armour” for one evening.A taxi with 7 passengers suffered a flat tyre whilst negotiating Wrynose Pass. The driver left the party to go and find help as he couldn’t change the tyre due to the steepness of the road.Unfortunately he seemed to be taking a long time and after a couple of hours two of the passengers walked to the Three Shires Inn to ring the Police for assistance. We were happy to oblige and took two of our landrovers to the stranded group of cold people. Whilst there the driver returned with an AA Lowloader.We helped with the traffic control whilst the stricken taxi was dealt with. The AA Vehicle could only take a minimal number of passengers so we drove the remainder to Ambleside.We were out about 3 hours but the passengers had obviously been waiting for a lot longer.We like to be versatile !!,Wrynose Pass,2012,26,October,41,NA,NA
"13 personnel were deployed to help a young female who had hurt her back.She was close to the Pudding Stone in this rough area which is full of boulders. The casualty slipped at the end of a long day. Fortunately the Air Ambulance was able to attend, landing precariously on a flat piece of land close to the main track. She was put onto a spinal board and flown to Furness General hospital.The call out took 1 1/2hrs and we were able to drive all the way to the casualty…an unusual but welcome change.",Boulder Valley,2012,18,October,40,NA,NA
"A party of 4 walkers requested help to find their way off the fells.They were tired and were taking longer than anticipated to complete the walk. As such, they had only one torch to help with the darkness. The drizzle and cloud, as well as the very slippy terrain, also added to their problems.Fortunately the party was soon located as they had given a grid reference so we had an idea of their whereabouts. They were escorted safely to the waiting landrover and then driven back to their own cars.A successful call out taking less than 2 hours.",Birk Fell / Greenburn,2012,10,October,39,NA,NA

"The team was asked to assist the ambulance service once again with the evacuation, this time, of a male mountian biker.All the rain we have had has obviously caused tracks to be very slippy, especially the wooden boarding. The accident occurred in Grizedale Forest on the North Face Trail. The casualty came off his bike and injured, possibly fracturing, his right ankle.He was given pain relief whilst the ankle was splinted. The man was carried the short distance by stretcher to the waiting ambulance. He was then taken to Furness General Hospital.14 members responded to this call out which only took 1 1/4 hrs due to the location and easy access.",Grizedale Forest,2012,30,September,37,NA,NA
"The North West Ambulance Service requested our assistance with the transportation of their casualty.The lady, who was very poorly, lived in an area where access was difficult for an ambulance. Low Oxen Fell is north east of Coniston and is surrounded by narrow lanes. Paramedics were already in attendance when we arrived.The landrover was able to drive quite close to the property. She was secured in a casualty bag and onto the stretcher. It was only a very short carry to the vehicle. The lady was then taken to the main ambulance which was waiting about a mile away on the main road. She was rushed to Furness General Hospital.An easy call out taking 1 1/4hrs. We often assist the Ambulance Service in this way.",Low Oxen Fell,2012,26,September,36,NA,NA
"A female walker slipped and twisted her right ankle whilst walking on the main track down from Beacon Tarn (a quiet beautiful tarn nestled amongst the Blawith Fells), towards Stable Harvey.Her leg was splinted and she was stretchered to the landrover and then transferred to the waiting ambulance. The casualty was taken to Furness General Hospital.The call out took 3 1/4 hours because although the incident was not too far away, the terrain made the stretcher carry quite long. 10 members of the team attended.",Beacon Tarn,2012,22,September,35,NA,NA
"The team was called out to an accident in one of the quarries at Hodge Close, near Tilberthwaite.A climber was abseiling when his equipment failed (we do not have the details as to what exactly happened). He fell between 15′-20′ and sustained a broken left femur, as well as facial injuries. This is a very serious injury so time was of the essence.Paramedics from the North West Air Ambulance were also in attendance. They administered strong painkilling drugs whilst a special traction splint was applied to his leg stabilising the fracture. He was put on a stretcher and the difficult task of bringing him back up out of the quarry began.Rope systems were put in place to ensure the procedure was as safe and as smooth as possible. Once on firm ground the casualty was then carried to the waiting helicopter and taken to Preston Royal Infirmary.The call out took 2 1/2 hours and 20 team members turned out.",Hodge Close,2012,14,September,34,NA,NA
"Having just finished a training evening, the team was soon re-united to go to the aid of two male cyclists in Grizedale Forest.A father and son had got lost amongst the many forestry tracks as the darkness descended. It was raining but the good news was that they had found some portable toilets in which to shelter. The bad news was that they didn’t obviously know where they were and none of the 13 team members who turned out knew of these portaloos. It was too late to contact the Forestry Commission.So two landrovers split up and searched different areas of the forest. The cyclists were found near High Cross, cold but safe. They were encouraged to get back on their bikes and follow us out of the forest. One of the landrovers accompanied the men back to their campsite in Hawkshead to ensure their safety. The call out took nearly 1 3/4 hrs.One of the advantages of being in the forest at that time of the night was being able to catch glimpses of the wildlife. We saw a young deer, a stag and a badger. Beautiful.",Grizedale Forest,2012,11,September,33,NA,NA
"We were called to the assistance of 3 female walkers who had become lost in the mist somewhere near the Old Man.12 members attended the call out and were split into 4 teams, each searching a different area. It was extremely misty at times which didn’t help progress. Fortunately the casualties were found safe but very wet, near the summit of Great Howe.Great Howe is a fell which seems to attract lost people in mist and they can become cragfast. However in this instance although the ladies did not know where they were, they had the sense to stay put rather than venture onto the crags.Once located they were accompanied down Levers Hause and to the warmth of the waiting landrover and then on to the base. A taxi was called to take them back to Ambleside whilst the team was treated to a well earned drink.The call out took 3 hours, most of which was in the rain.",Old Man area,2012,10,September,32,NA,NA
"Once again I had the choice whether to leave my desk at work or attend this call out. Second day on the trot. No contest really. We have had quite a few call outs this month and yet the team continues to man these incidents well. 15 members turned out for this one…and it was raining hard !!A lady was walking down the main track towards Glen Mary Bridge from Tarn Haws to view the Tom Ghyll waterfalls. She slipped and banged her head, resulting in a deep cut to her forehead.It is difficult to assess the seriousness of a head injury as the symptoms do not always manifest immediately. Fortunately the North West Air Ambulance was able to attend and paramedics were already on scene when the team arrived. Although we had the stretcher ready it was decided to assist the lady in walking to the ambulance where she would be assessed. She was well and able to do this comfortably.She was later taken to the Royal Lancaster Infirmary. It only took 1 1/4 hrs to deal with this call out due to the close location and simple evacuation.",Tom Ghyll,2012,29,August,31,NA,NA
A female walker slipped on loose gravel whilst walking along this very stony track.She sustained an ankle injury and was given pain relief whilst the leg was splinted. The incident happened just above the rock gate so the stretcher carry was only a very short one.About 20 minutes after returning to the base the ambulance arrived and took her to Furness General Hospital.11 members of the team attended to this call out which took 1 3/4 hr.,Walna Scar,2012,28,August,30,NA,NA
"And another one for August !!! But note the duration.The team was called to the assistance of a gentleman at Yew Tree Tarn. Whilst with a party of walkers he had slipped.However, the team was stood down within 5 minutes as a First Responder was already on scene followed quickly by the ambulance crew.",Yew Tree Farm,2012,26,August,29,NA,NA
A female walker slipped on wet ground on the track from Brackenbarrow to the lake.She had injured her right ankle. She was given pain relief as her leg was splinted. The casualty was stretchered to our landrover ambulance. She was later taken by ambulance to Furness General Hospital.This was a fairly easy call out due to its location.,Torver Common,2012,NA,NA,28,NA,NA
"Ambulance Control called us for assistance on this occasion instead of the Police. This happens from time to time when they need some help to actually move the casualty when access is difficult for their ambulance.There had been a mountain bike accident on the track north of Tarn Hows. However, the injured person had been moved to the main road and as such easily picked up by the ambulance before the team arrived. We were therefore recalled.",Tarn Hows,2012,19,August,27,NA,NA
"An organised group of teenagers were enjoying themsleves scambling along Church Beck. This is a popular pastime and the waterfalls from below Miners Bridge make it more so if there has been heavy rain.
On this occasion, the team was called to the aid of a female teenager who had simply slipped on the wet rock. She sustained a possible fracture or sprain to her left ankle. Her leg was splinted and she was stretchered to our landrover ambulance.
It was a short ride to the rescue base where she was able to swop her very wet clothes for dry ones. She was then taken to Furness General Hospital.
This was a relatively short call out due to its location and 10 team members attended. We were glad it was a short one because the heavens opened on us all that afternoon.",Church Beck,2012,15,August,26,NA,NA
"The police instigated a call out to assist a lone male who had been biking in Grizedale Forest. He had become disorientated as it got darker.
However, the team leader was able to establish by phone exactly where the gentleman was and thus direct him back to the main car park at the Visitors Centre.
The rest of the team was therefore blissfully unaware that their evening could have been disrupted ie. Number of team personnel involved 1, length of call out 10 minutes.",Grizedale Forest,2012,14,August,25,NA,NA
"The team was called to the aid of a youth who had a possible broken ankle.However, we wThe team was called out to assist the Langdale & Ambleside Mountain Rescue Team.
A teenager had a suspected badly sprained ankle. Unfortunately she was at Angle Tarn, a beautifully positioned tarn below the Bowfell Range, but it would necessitate a long awkward carry out by stretcher.
Although LAMRT is a large team, there are occasions when members are already deployed on other incidents or unable to attend, so a request for help from another neighbouring team is not uncommon. In this instance however, whilst en route, we were informed that the Air Ambulance was picking up the casualty. So we turned around and headed home, having just reached Elterwater.ere then advised that a forestry vehicle had picked up the casualty and taken him to an ambulance. The team was therefore stood down.",Angle Tarn,2012,9,August,24,NA,NA
"The team leader was contacted by a local farmer saying that he thought someone was in need of assistance on Dow Crag.
As this was not a formal, confirmed call out via the police, and because it was night time, the whole team was not asked to respond. Instead 4 members went to investigate. They met up with some climbers who were out late but did not need any help.
At least it was a dry clear night!",Dow Crag,2012,8,August,23,NA,NA
"The team was called to the aid of a youth who had a possible broken ankle.However, we were then advised that a forestry vehicle had picked up the casualty and taken him to an ambulance. The team was therefore stood down.12 members attended this call out.This is the second ankle injury in a few days , so watch how you go people. An easy accident to have, especially on wet rough ground.","Carron Crag, Grizedale",2012,24,July,22,NA,NA
"The team was back at Tarn Hows today.
We went to the assistance of a lady who had been walking along the tourist track which runs alongside Tom Gill. She had slipped on wet ground sustaining a possible fracture to her left ankle.
She was given pain relief after which her leg was splinted. The lady was then stretchered to the waiting ambulance. The path can be narrow in places so the carry was quite awkward in parts.
She was taken to Furness General Hospital.",Tarn Hows,2012,21,July,21,NA,NA
The team was called to assist a male who had hurt his back.He had been exploring one of the areas just off the main track around Tarn Hows. Unfortunately he slipped off a log and fell awkwardly injuring his back. Access was quite easy for the landrover ambulance to get close.Paramedics attended to the casualty and he was taken to Furness General Hospital.The call out deployed 11 members of the team and took 1 1/2 hours. A nice easy short one.,Tarn Hows,2012,15,July,20,NA,NA
"The team was called to attend to a youth who had suffered an epileptic fit.His location ie. at the footbridge which runs over Tilberthwaite Gill, meant that assistance would have been needed if the boy did not recover well. Fortunately, when the team arrived he had stopped fitting. He felt well enough to walk down the track back to the school bus accompanied by team members.",Tilberthwaite Gill,2012,5,July,19,NA,NA
"A young man was with an army training group. They were walking along the main tourist track from Goats Hawse to the top of the Old Man when he slipped over on his ankle.This resulted in an injury, possibly a fracture, to his lower leg. Although the Air Ambulance attempted to assist with the evacuation they had to turn back due to the low cloud and mist. This meant that the team was faced with a long and quite difficult carry out to the Walna Scar road where our landrover ambulance was parked. Not only was it steep in places, but the path by Goats Water is full of boulders. The damp weather did not help as this obviously caused the terrain to be slippy too.It was decided to ask Duddon & Furness Mountain Rescue Team for assistance, and they helped with the stretcher carry. It was well appreciated.The casualty was given pain relief, his leg was splinted and then he was evacuated safely down the mountain. An ambulance was already waiting for him at the Rescue Base.The whole call out deployed over 20 rescue team members and took 4 hours.",Goats Hause,2012,4,July,18,NA,NA
The team is sometimes asked to assist local people when help is required under special circumstances.Today three members responded to a request to help with the relocation of a person.,Coniston,2012,NA,NA,17,NA,NA
"A male fell runner slipped just over the summit of Dow Crag whilst participating in a fell race.Due to the damp cool and misty conditions he soom became hypothermic although being cared for by the race marshalls. As well as CMRT being alerted a RAF helipcopter was also requested. Duddon & Furness Mountain Rescue Team assisted due to the proximity of the casulty as well as the fact that they were just in the process of completing an earlier call out further down in the Seathwaite area.The casualty soon warmed up once safely in the casualty bag. He was then stretchered down the mountain to the waiting landrover which had been driven further up the Walnar Scar Track than normal so as to expedite the evacuation. The RAF helicopter was able to land in the vicinity and the gentleman was evacuated to Carlisle hospital as a precaution.This incident was very labour intensive due to it’s location and the conditions, utilising a total of 30 mountain rescue team members as well as taking some 4 hours in total.",Dow Crag,2012,9,June,16,NA,NA
"After a callout free month, we had to get back into the mood to go to the aid of a female mountain biker.Although not actually cycling at the time, she fell suffering a severe laceration to her shin. The leg was already bandaged but she was given antibiotics due to the deep nature of the injury.She was stretchered to the landrover and taken to the base where an ambulance was waiting to take her to hospital.This was a relatively short call out as most of the distance could be covered by vehicle and the location of the accident was not too far from the village.",Iron Keld,2012,4,June,15,NA,NA
"Early this morning we were called to assist a party of 3 (one male and two females) who had become lost in the dark.They were found at Hoathwaite, south of Coniston Hall. The party had become disorientated due to the dark and woods.Because of the time of the call out (ie. early hours of the morning)and the fact it could be identified where they were, a full team call out was not actioned. Three team members located the party safe and unhurt, and took them back to their camp site.",Hoathwaite,2012,29,April,14,NA,NA
The team was called out to a female who had fallen off her mountain bike.The casualty was on the main track from Low Parkamoor to Heald Brow in Grizedale Forest.

Duddon & Furness Mountain Rescue Team were also deployed as the walkers had been and still could be in their area. Since it would be dark soon, the more people searching for the ladies, the better.Eventually they were found by the Coniston Team which used whistles to locate the ladies. They were safe and well and returned to Coniston Base by the Duddon & Furness Landrover as this vehicle was much closer to them.",Seathwaite Fells,2012,6,April,12,NA,NA
The team was called out to attend to a male walker who was suffering from breathing difficulties.He was located on the Wet Side Edge path on Greenburn.

"Coniston had suffered galeforce winds over night which were continuing during the day in unexpected heavy gusts.Unfortunately a female walker was blown onto some rock whilst walking near Goatswater. Her walking companions were able to assist her to the Walnar Scar track. However as she had sustained a head injury and was suffering from concussion the team was called out. This was mainly because due to the location, an ambulance was unable to get close enough. She was given oxygen at the scene.Fortunately, the air ambulance was able to attend and after some excellent flying in poor conditions, the casualty was airlifted to Furness General Hospital.",Above Cove Bridge / Walna Scar,2012,21,January,3,NA,NA
"A mountain biker came off his bike sustaining a deep laceration to his knee.One of the team members was in a position to actually pick this casualty up and bring him to the base, whilst his friends took care of his bike. At the base his wound was re-dressed and due to the nature of the injury he was given antibiotics.Rather than call for an ambulance, the gentleman was able to make arrangements for someone to drive him to Furness General.It is not often we get the luxury of treating a casualty at the base !",Hodge Close / Holme Fell,2012,8,January,2,NA,NA

However as the day went on and darkness closed in they became disorientated and lost their way. After trying unsuccessfully to find their own way back to their car they decided to call for help.Thanks to the SARLOC system (a way of locating people via their mobile phone) their position in the forest was soon identified, and one Land Rover was deployed to pick them up. A full team call out was therefore unnecessary. The party was driven back to their own vehicle safe and well.6 team members were involved in this incident which took 1 ¼ hours.",Grizedale Forest,2013,29,December,45,NA,NA
"The weather was wet and windy and as dusk was setting in the light was becoming poorer.A party of six walkers had walked over the summit of Coniston Old Man and then became lost. As it would soon be dark and there was a child with them, they were a little worried and therefore requested assistance.The Team was put on standby whilst information was gathered as to where they may be and how they were actually descending. It had been reported but not confirmed at the time, that another family member was talking them down. Apparently the party was already on its way off the fell via Goats Hawse and Goats Water. The Team deployed a couple of vehicles and the walkers were soon located not far from the Walna Scar track.

Areas covered were Tarn Hows (Tom Gill Waterfall), High Cross, the east side of Coniston Water, and Hodge Close. Two dog handlers, one from Duddon & Furness MR team and one from Langdale & Ambleside MR Team also responded to the call out. A Search and Rescue helicopter was utilised to assist.

"The weather was very wet with low cloud and mist. There was a breeze in some pockets of the fells.A family party of 2 adults and two children had become lost in the mist. The location they gave was on the top of Coniston Old Man. However, we were able to pinpoint them as actually being on Dow Crag, thanks to the SARLOC system which enable us to locate casualties via their mobile phone if it has a GPS program. The group was instructed to stay where they were.Two land rovers set off equipped with torches and Search Sacks. Every half hour the mobile phone being used for communication was re checked for its position so that we could be sure the party had not moved. Due to the location identified it was decided the quickest route would be via Goatswater and Goats Hause. They were found just a short distance off the main track, cold and wet, but safe, and accompanied down off the fell to the land rovers. Once back at base the family was given drinks to warm them up.13 Team personnel responded to this call out which took 3 hours.",Dow Crag,2013,30,October,40,NA,NA
"Although not a call out…. the team did go out on a rescue mission!!On Saturday, 5th October, a couple who were on holiday had been walking on Torver Back Common, an area which rises quite steeply at times above the western shoreline of Coniston Water. There are many footpaths and sheep trods frequenting this partially wooded and bracken covered region. The gentleman had slipped and let go of Pip along with her extendable lead. This had spooked poor Pip who then ran off.Although the couple searched for a long time she could not be found. Posters were placed in strategic positions around Torver and Coniston. The Team was contacted on Monday evening by a fantastic organisation called Dog Lost http://www.doglost.co.uk/ asking if we would keep a look out for Pip, a small Jack Russell terrier.Tuesday evening was a training night for the team and it so happened that it was to be centred around Searching, with a practice on Torver Common. It was agreed that we should carry out a search for the dog as part of the training. Details were taken from the owner as to where and when it was last seen or heard, as well as Pip’s personality and useful traits. Squeaky toys and treats seemed high on the agenda as good searching tools.After the initial training on methods and techniques to be employed, the team split into two, with details of the areas to be covered. One team took the high route and the other followed the shore path, looking above the path itself with the aim to rendezvous at a given point. Line searches (where members walked in a line but at a distance apart) were carried out by the teams, but this was at times an arduous task because of the rough terrain.When we met up, there had been no sign of Pip….. so we decided to return to the landrovers but to carry out one last long line search covering the open ground above the tree line.And then we struck gold! One of the team members saw what he thought were “cats eyes”, but were in fact Pip’s eyes. Her lead had been snagged in the bracken so although she could run around, she could not actually go very far. The relief and sheer amazement that we had actually found her, was felt by everyone involved in the search.She was well, just cold and hungry. The very excited little dog emptied her bowels on one member as a show of appreciation!!!!!, before being carried back to the vehicles nestled in a jacket and fed the occasional “Cheesy Bite” and dog biscuit along the way.Pip was reunited with her very grateful owners who had made their way to the Base.A brilliant training session which lasted 3 hours and involved 13 team personnel.",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"The weather was dry with intermittent cloud and sunshine and a light wind.A couple had set off for a walk in Grizedale Forest but the gentleman had soon become tired. He decided to return to the car whilst his wife carried on walking the dogs. However when she returned, her husband was not yet back. As he had an underlying health condition and had not been feeling too well lately, she was concerned.The team was actually heavily involved with marshalling a Lakeland Trail Race, but this incident took priority. However, within 10 minutes of deployment we received notification that he had been found safe and well, so the team was stood down. The race at this point had not yet been severely affected.",Grizedale Forest,2013,5,October,39,NA,NA
"It was a dry, clear evening but torches were needed for the second half of the rescue.A couple with their son were descending towards the quarry after climbing Coniston Old Man earlier that afternoon. The lady slipped and twisted her knee. She did try to continue but it was too painful to bear weight.We were able to drive the landrovers most of the way up the quarry road. The casualty was soon located thanks to the husband making himself clearly visible. She was kept warm whilst the stretcher was being put together. She had sustained possible ligament injuries although a fracture could not be ruled out. Once her leg was splinted, the lady was stretchered about half a mile to the team vehicles and driven to the base. As the family lived locally they wanted to make their own way to Westmorland General Hospital. Since we had not administered any drugs we respected their wishes and therefore transferred her to their own car for the onward journey.13 members of the team responded to this incident which took 2 hours.","Bursting Stone Quarry, Coniston",2013,28,September,38,NA,NA

"The weather was mild, dry but misty on the tops.A gentleman and his friend had climbed Coniston Old Man and walked along the ridge to Great Carrs when he started to feel unwell. A passing couple had telephoned for help. It was decided to approach the rescue from the northern side of the fell via Wrynose Pass and Wet Side Edge. Five members of the team including a SARDA dog, were initially deployed to carry up the equipment which may have been needed, whilst the remainder of the team followed a little later. The casualty was located and because he had rested, he declared he now felt well enough to walk slowly down. However, it soon became apparent that he was quite exhausted. He was stretchered down the fell which in itself was quite arduous due to the rough and slippy terrain. His condition was monitored during the carry. The North West Air Ambulance was able to land in the valley, so once we arrived at the Three Shires Stone, he was transferred to the landrover and driven to the helicopter for his onward journey to Preston Royal Infirmary.The couple who had found the gentleman had assisted with this rescue too.A total of 11 Team members attended this incident which took 4 ½ hours.",Great Carrs,2013,NA,NA,36,NA,NA
"The weather was sunny with some cloud, quite mild and dry. There was intermittent mist above 1500ft.The team was called to the assistance of a gentleman who had apparently fallen in South Rake, a popular scramble for walkers leading up to the Dow Crag ridge. Due to the possible seriousness of the incident the North West Air Ambulance was en route and an RAF Sea King was also deployed.The first landrover was quickly dispatched so that personnel could take up the necessary equipment. The second soon followed bringing more team members and additional equipment. However, at the bottom of South Rake, the calls from the casualty determined that he was in fact in Easy Gully, the next one along. After a scramble he was located 2/3rds up the gully. He had taken the wrong path and then slipped on greasy rock and fallen 30-40ft. The casualty had sustained head, hip and possible pelvic and internal injuries. Whilst the stretcher was safely secured and the logistics of the rescue was being discussed the gentleman was given pain relief, oxygen, and made comfortable. Two NWAA paramedics were able to climb up to the area with support from a team member. The casualties pelvis was splinted and once safely on the stretcher, he was lowered down the gully using a belay system. It was necessary to loosen and kick away boulders and rocks on the route in order for a safe carry out.Once out of the gully, although still at the top of the screes, he was winched up by the RAF helicopter and taken to Preston Royal Infirmary.In total 14 team members attended this call out and we were also assisted by two local and known climbers. It took 5 ½ hours and another hour to replenish stock and sort out equipment.","Easy Gully, Dow Crag",2013,22,September,35,NA,NA

Not long after midnight he had wandered too near the edge of one of the rocks which frequent the area above the lake at the bottom of the quarry. He slipped falling approx.50ft into the water. Fortunately the accident was heard by a friend who was able to drag him to relative safety.When the team arrived paramedics and the fire service were already at the top of the quarry waiting for us to find a safe route to gain access to the casualty. Lights had been set up at the edge of the quarry. He was located below the cave suffering from severe head and chest injuries, although there was a possibility of other injuries. However due to the precarious position the gentleman was in ie. on a rough slate slope with part of him submerged, urgent evacuation was paramount. Whilst he was being treated, ropes were used to secure both the casualty and the stretcher before he was lifted on to it. Paramedics had been lead to the scene by one of the team members via a safer route.

Another team member manned the base. A search was carried out below Levers Water around the Water Treatment Plant, and then across to the Red Dell area. However, despite seeing a light, there was no sighting of people or tents and no response to shouting. It was decided that because no one had been reported missing, and the search had not revealed any problems, then they should stand the rest of the team down and return to base.There was a possibilty due to information received that the light could have actually been a lantern, possibly stuck on a rock and moving in the wind.3 Team Members, as mentioned, responded physically to the incident and the search took an hour.No further reports manifested from this initial call out.",Copper Mines Valley,2013,21,June,22,NA,NA

Her partner back climbed and managed to free her leg, however extensive damage had been caused to the soft tissue of her knee and she was unable to stand on the leg.Initially assistance was requested from the Great North Air Ambulance as the carry out on a stretcher would have been long and arduous from Low Water Tarn. The casualties were located higher than had been expected and on the crag. The decision was made to call an RAF Sea King for assistance with extraction as winching would be required to remove the casualty from their position. Whilst awaiting the RAF the air ambulance was able to transport 5 MR Team members, together with their kit, to the summit ridge. This enabled the party to be reached quickly where medical care was given. The location dictated that ropes, helmets and harnesses were a necessity for all parties on the crag. The Sea King arrived and the lady was safely winched, along with her partner, to safety.

Due to the heavy drifts and deep snow, the team was faced with a longer and more difficult walk in than usual. The casualty was therefore advised that we would be with him in about 1 1/2hrs. This obviously influenced the man because he decided to attempt to climb out of the gully. He successfully made it on to the ridge and was able to walk off the fell safely without our aid. The team leader asked him to let us know when he was back down, which he duly did.This meant that the 12 team members who were deployed were only active for an hour, although it was understood that the incident would not be closed down until we had received the final call from the walker to say he was safe.","South Rake, Dow Crag, March",2013,31,NA,9,NA,NA

"This was a united effort involving 4 Mountain Rescue Teams, Coniston, Duddon & Furness, Langdale & Ambleside and Kendal as well as a RAF Helicopter.The Team was initially called out to the aid of two females suffering from suspected hypothermia. They were in a party of 5 walkers who were trying to make their way off the Coniston Old Man ridge via Levers Hawse, above Levers Water. Conditions were very bad following Friday’s and Saturday’s heavy snow, resulting in deep snow and high drifts, and an approximate wind speed of 35mph. This together with the wind chill factor would have meant that the air temperature could have been as low as -15 degrees C. Although chains were put on our landrovers, they struggled to get as far as usual up Coppermines Valley.As the call out progressed a third casualty was then identified together with two other people just before the northern end of Levers Water on the West side of the lake. Since there could now be a possibility of having to stretcher two casualties and hopefully walk the third out, a second request for attendance was therefore initiated. Once it was identified that conditions were extremely difficult especially due to the high snow drifts, Duddon & Furness Mountain Rescue Team were also called to assist. The lead team reported that one of the initial casualties was seriously hypothermic. The decision was made to call for the RAF Helicopter which could evacuate the ladies much quicker and safer. We also requested the assistance of Langdale and Ambleside Mountain Rescue Team, together with the Autopulse portable CPR device. Thankfully it wasn’t required and all three were airlifted to hospital by RAF Boulmer. Had the RAF been unable to winch the casualties to safety, carrying 3 stretchers in up to waist deep snow would have required a lot of man power and determination. Eventually we had 22 members of Coniston Team and personnel from 3 other teams (including Kendal Mountain rescue Team) all deployed in one way or another.Seven members of the original walking party of 15,who did not require medical assistance, were given a lift back down to the base where they were able to get warm through drinks and food. The teams made their way off the fell and back to the base. Hot drinks and choccie were supplied, although I think most people were looking forward more to descending on the pub.This was a strenuous call out which could have had even more serious consequences. So if you are thinking of going up in the fells at the moment, please be aware that it can be treacherous in places and perhaps re-consider your walk if necessary.The incident took 5 ¼ hours but I am pleased to say that at the time of writing all the ladies were doing well.","Levers Hawse, March",2013,24,NA,7,NA,NA
"22nd & 23rd March, South Lakeland Area/MillomOver the last 36 hours, about 14″ of snow has fallen over South and West Cumbria.The team deployed three landrovers yesterday and one today, helping people who were stuck in vehicles and assisting schoolchildren returning home. We also attended an incident in Millom working alongside other Mountain Rescue Teams.Please also take a look at the linked article below and take note from the advice being givenAvalanche warningIf planning a visit keep an eye on the forecasts and conditions…. take care out there folks!!",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"We have had another fall of snow over the weekend but because of the higher temperature it isn’t actually freezing, thus making the ground wet and slippy. This female casualty was walking around Torver Intake behind Tarn Hows when she slipped on the soft wet snow. Unfortunately she fell awkwardly sustaining a very painful injury to her elbow, which was possibly fractured.Some good torch communication from the knoll by her partner enabled us to locate the casualty. She was given pain relief whilst the arm was put in a splint and sling. Because the landrovers were able to drive within about a hundred metres the stretcher carry was very short. However, the rough track back down to the road meant that the vehicle had to go quite slow because of the painful nature of the injury.The Ambulance was already at the base waiting so she was soon on her way to Furness General Hospital.13 members attended the call out which took 1 ¾ hour.(And my job today was to look after their dog..couldn’t ask for a better task!!)","Tarn Hows, March",2013,18,NA,6,NA,NA
"Well we have had a very quiet start to the new year, so it was just a matter of time before the lull in the incidents came to an end.The Team was called to a similar incident as the previous one. A lady had slipped on wet grass whilst walking with a group near the Three Dubs Tarn on Claife Heights, and possibly fractured her ankle. Two landrovers went to her assistance and access was good because of the forest tracks in the area. She was given pain relief as the ankle was splinted. Unfortunately the ETA for the arrival of the ambulance was an hour and it was therefore decided to transport the lady to Furness General Hospital ourselves. Two team members were deployed with this task whilst the Base informed A&E of the situation.As we were now one landrover down our third vehicle came to the rescue to pick up the remainder of the team.12 Members attended this call out which took nearly 2 3/4hrs.","Claife Heights, March",2013,15,NA,5,NA,NA

"Snow had been falling thick and fast since the morning. We got a call from the police asking us to help a lady who’s vehicle had got stuck in the snow. Although we drove over Hawkshead Hill and along the road to Ambleside, we could not find a car with a passenger in who required our assistance, albeit there were a few stranded vehicles around. After contacting the police for a registration number we were informed that the lady had been helped and was now at work.So instead of feeling miffed we decided that at least we had training in putting the snow chains on and experiencing their effectiveness (we couldn’t have got up the hill without them), and of course the lady was safely at work!",Hawkshead Road February,2013,13,NA,3,NA,NA
"Just as the beautiful day was beginning to turn, and the rain starting to fall, we received a call out regarding two male walkers who had become crag fast above Levers Water.Two landrovers were deployed up the snow covered Coppermines Valley and our snowchains needed to be fitted in order to allow us access as far as possible. A strong turn out of 15 members enabled us to split into groups because the two walkers were not exactly sure where they were, which therefore necessitated approaches into the area from different routes. Although vocal communication could be heard it was difficult to locate their position at first. Eventually two team members made visual contact and proceeded to climb up to the men via a gully and the task of getting them off the fell safely, began.Due to their precarious position on the crags with the snow melting and conditions underfoot unstable, safety to both the team members and walkers was paramount. However with the use of ropes and belays they were assisted down to the lower slopes and eventually everyone made it thankfully back to the waiting landrovers ar Levers Water.It had been dark and wet for nearly 3 hours and on arrival at the Rescue Base hot drinks and chocolate were well received.The walkers had descended Brim Fell, but unfortunately were unable to find a safe route down once they had reached Raven Tor. They continued but became crag fast, neither being able to return up the crags or proceed any lower. Fortunately the two men were well equipped with clothing and footwear, including crampons, which meant that although cold, they were able to hang on to the rock and not become hypothermic during the incident. The call out took a total of nearly 4 1/2 hours because of the conditions.Just a message for everyone who goes out in the snow conditions we have just experienced, an ice axe and crampons is a partnership just as important as a map and compass.",Ravens Crag January,2013,26,NA,2,NA,NA
"Well, last year we averaged one incident a week and we have started early for 2013.We were called to the assistance of two walkers who had ascended Coniston Old Man. Unfortunately they had left their map & compass at home which meant that when the mist came down, they could not navigate easily off the mountain. However they seemed to know roughly where they were and decided to descend.The walkers were safely located on the Walna Scar track, a wide good track which runs from behind Coniston, below the Old Man, to Seathwaite in the Duddon Valley. They were taken by landrover back to their vehicles.Due to the nature of the incident, ie. experienced walkers who knew the area and were already making their way off the mountain, a full call out was not instigated. 5 team members attended and it took 1 ½ hours.",Walna Scar,2013,5,January,1,NA,NA

Recovery of their land rover, which was located not far from the car park at the Coniston end of the Walna Scar track, could wait until another day. They were first driven to the base so that details could be taken and then taken to the nearest home of one of the men.A full Team call-out was not initiated due to the circumstances.

She had managed to walk ¾ mile before being unable to continue. Her husband had made her warm and comfortable by the path, before setting off to get help down in Coniston.One land rover left the base with the first aid equipment, followed shortly after by a second vehicle. With instructions of where to find the casualty, she was soon located not far west from Cove Bridge. The lady was given added warmth whilst being treated for a deep laceration to her lower leg, which due to a possible fracture was also splinted. There were also signs of a suspect pelvic injury and so consequently she was placed in a vacuum mattress for extra stability during evacuation. The casualty was then stretchered about 2/3rds of a mile to the land rover before being taken to the base. An ambulance was already waiting there to take her to Furness General Hospital.Her husband was also treated whilst at the base for abrasions to his leg, as he also had slipped whilst making haste to arrange help.13 Team Members responded to this call out which took 2 hours.",Walna Scar,2014,20,November,40,NA,NA

The lady was stretchered up the embankment to the ambulance for her onward journey to Furness General Hospital. Her dog was taken back to the holiday home by team members, to be joined later by a member of the family.16 Team personnel attended this call out which took just over 2 hours.","Slape Scar, Windermere shore",2014,7,June,17,NA,NA
"This incident was initiated at 6.38am on the Saturday morning by the police. The period between then and the full team call out was spent by the Team Leader liaising with Cumbria Police and Langdale and Ambleside Mountain Rescue Team.The weather remained mainly damp with heavy showers throughout the day.A young man had been reported missing from late the previous evening leading to a high degree of concern for his safety. The area designated for the search bordered LAMRT’s and Coniston’s home ground, hence their involvement.The Team members were split in to two parties each supported by police and police dog handlers and tasked to search the quarries and caves within the Little Langdale, Tilberthwaite and Hodge Close areas. However, during this time, two members of the public approached one of the groups. Their information lead to the location and subsequent identification of the missing person who had been seen at Moss Rigg Quarry. While the Team stoodby, the police were able to negotiate with the young man and he was safely apprehended.In total 13 Coniston Team Members responded to this call out which took 6 1/2 hours from when active, but had in reality taken 9 hours from the initial request for assistance by Cumbria Police.",Little Langdale,2014,10,May,16,NA,NA
The weather remained dry although the air was damp.The team was called to help a female walker who had become disorientated in the Satterthwaite area of Grizedale Forest. From the information provided it was going to be easy to locate her and therefore a full team call out was not initiated. She was soon picked up and reunited with friends near Esthwaite water.Five Team Personnel attended this incident which took 1 1/2 hrs,Grizedale Forest,2014,4,May,15,NA,NA
"During this period we received two call outs, both of which did not ultimately need our assistance and we were stood down shortly afterwards. The Team Leader however remained in contact on both occasions to ensure the safety of all those involved,Firstly 4 walkers reported themselves as being lost in mist. They had climbed the Old Man, but wandered off course. Fortunately some people were able to escort them down from Brown Pike, at the southern end of Dow Crag.Secondly, a lady was suffering from hypoglycaemia whilst on the ridge near Levers Hawse. After a while the sugar intake started to take affect and she was well enough to walk off the fell with the aid of people in her party.",th May,2014,4,May,14,NA,NA
"It was a dry, fairly sunny day, with light cloud.The North West Ambulance Service requested our assistance with the evacuation of a gentleman. He had slipped somewhere in the vicinity of the Cumbria Way, near the shoreline west of Coniston Water.

"The weather was wet and misty but mild.Two reports had been received by the police about shouts for help heard from a man up on Oxen Fell/Holme Fell. The team was able to meet up with one of the people who had reported the incident and was directed accordingly.Initially the team in the first land rover split into three smaller groups in order to cover the search area, agreeing to rendezvous at Uskdale Gap further west on Holme Fell. After a second team call out for other members to attend, another land rover was deployed with a party of 4 to meet up with the rest of the team at the same position. Although we called out throughout the search no response was received. At Uskdale it was decided that the cries for help would probably have been misinterpreted, as so often happens and easily done. On returning to the land rover a farmer was spotted and after a conversation with him our thoughts were confirmed. He had indeed been calling his dog whose name happens to be so very similar to the word “help”. Relieved we all returned to base.In total 14 team personnel responded to this call out which took 3 hours.",Holme Fell,2014,5,April,11,NA,NA
The weather was dry but cloudy.The team was called out to search for a couple who had become lost in Grizedale Forest.

By the next morning Wasdale, Duddon and Furness, Cockermouth, Keswick, Kirby Stephen, Coniston and Kendal Mountain rescue teams were helping together with the Lake District Search and Rescue Dogs.Coniston MRT was tasked to search various areas with other MR teams doing the same, the main routes being the tourist tracks on and surrounding the Scafell range and Great Gable, together with all the neighbouring mountains and valleys. Coniston split into two groups to maximise search area. At mid-day two team personnel returned to base with the main land rover so that in the event of a local call out, we had enough team members and vehicles to respond.During our second search of the day we were informed that a member of the public had possibly found the casualty. The other teams were alerted whilst we continued to the location as we were already on the approach. When Wasdale MRT arrived they took over as this was originally their call out.12 Coniston Team members attended this incident and we were out 11 ¾ hours.

Worried in case there was a problem, they decided to report this possibility and the team was therefore asked to investigate.The Team Leader made contact with the couple for more information. From the facts presented, instead of calling out the whole team, three Assistant Team Leaders went up the fell to ascertain whether assistance was required or not. However, once they had met up with the group it was explained that they were doing some rope work, hence the slow movement of the party. The members therefore returned to base.5 Team Personnel attended to this incident which took 1 1/2 hours.",Low Water Slopes,2014,4,March,7,NA,NA

Members carried medical equipmentand the stretcher up to Swirl Hawse where they split up to search the surrounding area. A North West Air Ambulance also assisted by sweeping the fells to look for the suspected casualty, but they were unable to locate any one. It was eventually determined that this was actually a shepherding incident as farmers could be seen and heard in the Greenburn Valley, on the north eastern side of Swirl How.

A family of four – mother, father and two children, plus their dog had become lost in mist after setting off earlier to complete a circular walk in the Coniston Fells. They were getting cold and wet and they had no means of navigation off the fell.The Duty Leader was able to pinpoint their position as the informant described it as at a memorial to a Halifax Bomber, which we know is near the summit of Great Carrs. This was confirmed by using our Phone Find Tool via our SARCall logging system, which gives us a pinpoint on our electronic mapping system.Given that visibility was very poor and unfortunately with no map and compass to help them self rescue, and the possibility of getting into further difficulty with some quite nasty ground in the vicinity, we deployed two land rovers’ worth of personnel. We ascended from Levers Water then went via Swirl Hawse, Prison band and Swirl How.

"It was a sunny but freezing evening, with some snow on the tops and some ice still present on the paths. We had trouble earlier in another very busy day on the fells with a car parked badly at the Fell Gate car park, blocking our access to the Walna Scar road which allow us to get our Land Rovers and equipment closer to incidents and casualties. A team member managed to persuade the car driver to move before our Land Rovers arrived.With darkness imminent (sunset was 15.56 today), we were called by Cumbria Police about a solo climber who was stuck on Dow Crag. He had no climbing gear with him and was apparently climbing on C Buttress, probably on the C-Ordinary route. He had climbed past some ice and saw more above, hence decided he was stuck, and so called for help. Two team members were on the adjacent hill, and were quickly at the bottom of the crag.We despatched two Land Rovers to drive as far as we could, and walked the rest of the way to Dow with all our crag rescue and night gear. With daylight limited and a long crag rescue likely into the night, we asked for helicopter assistance, and Rescue 936 (HM Coastguard S-92 from Caernarfon) was tasked to help.They arrived overhead, and, due to concerns over the downwash from the helicopter blowing the climber off the crag, the crew had a practice on a nearby crag first. They formulated a plan and decided to go ahead with an inch-perfect display of precision night flying.

Four lads got stuck on a ledge while descending from Great How where there is no path, and were noticed by a passing walker who called Cumbria Police for help. One of the party then managed to descend, but the other three saw how close he came to a big fall, and decided to stay put. We were called out, and despatched three Land Rovers to Levers Water dam. We then hiked up with all our kit across the screes to the base of the crag. Two of our team climbed a gully to their side, climbed over to their ledge, set up a belay and lowered the remaining three down using team harnesses.It transpired that they thought that they were climbing and descending the Old Man of Coniston, which is more than a mile away from Great How, having parked their car at the Fell Gate car park and walked right past the Old Man.

"Winter conditions continued to prevail on our fells, with plenty of snow remaining high up and a ‘feels like’ temperature well below zero Centigrade. The weak sunshine did little to warm up the flank of Dow Crag. These are conditions which are easy to anticipate by looking at a good weather forecast (e.g. Met Office), and should have prompted anyone contemplating anything adventurous to use crampons and an ice axe, having already learned how to use them.Two scramblers got into difficulty ascending Easy Gulley, and became cragfast on very steep ground to the edge of the gully. There is a chockstone blocking it, and a known scramble around it, but they appeared to have pushed on into climbers’ territory on A Buttress without any gear, and were now stuck on a narrow ledge. They called Cumbria Police, who in turn called us.We despatched two Land Rovers as far up the Walna Scar road as we can drive, and then started the long hike, with all our crag, ropes, winter and night kit, up to Dow Crag via Brown Pike, looking to descend to the stuck party. Because of the limited remaining daylight (sunset was at 15.50), we requested helicopter assistance, and Rescue 199 from Prestwick was tasked to help. Their flying time to Dow was quicker than our hiking time with kit, so they arrived first, and took the decision to pick them off the crag with the helicopter’s winch. The very cold scramblers were then flown down to the fell-gate car park, and driven to our base for a debrief.

We were called to help by Cumbria Police. Because that location has no tracks for our Land Rovers to get anywhere near, a very long and steep stretcher carry was likely, so we requested a helicopter and another team’s assistance. The casualty was assessed, pain relief given and his ankle injury reduced, and he was packaged in our stretcher for evacuation.Fortunately, Coastguard helicopter Rescue 199 became available, and flew down from Prestwick to assist. The winchman was lowered to our casualty, and both were winched back into the hovering helicopter, which flew him to Cumberland Infirmary Carlisle hospital.This incident involved 15 members, and a doctor from LAMRT, plus 12 members of Duddon and Furness MRT who turned out to help if a long stretcher evacuation had been required.

Since he then received a response, he worried it may be someone in distress and hence made the call.A small party and two vehicles were deployed to investigate. They were split into two groups with the aim to R/V at Windy Gap. En route to Windy Gap a walker informed us they too had seen the red light, but there were other torch lights behind them. (These turned out to be the other team members). We all walked up to Low Water and scoured the area for tents with the aim of obtaining info. as to whether they had seen anyone camping on the top of the OM. However, there was nobody else in the vicinity, and no lights seen, even with high viz torch, so we descended back to Windy Gap. We justified this action thinking that if someone needed assistance they would have asked for it, and if camping, would have ensured their phones had sufficient battery life to see them through the night. We had not received any notification of missing persons either. Then one team, on their way to Fellgate, saw a strong torch to the right, on the slopes between the main tourist track and Bursting Stone Quarries. We parked up at Fellgate and observed the light which appeared to be moving down towards the car park. When the second vehicle arrived, four members went on foot to investigate, (really just to ascertain whether they had been on the top of the Old Man, and that they were not in need of any assistance), being directed by a member in the vehicle via radio. Two campers were located on Timley Knott, safe and well, and they confirmed they had been flashing the red torch from the top of the OM.

"The fell-tops were in cloud and the Met forecast gusts over 40mph. Our colleagues at Duddon and Furness MRT (DFMRT) had a callout for a lost walker on Great Carrs. Since this was just within our boundary between our respective ‘patches’, they called us to advise of the incident. The female walker had lost her map in the high wind and was disoriented in the cloud, and hence called for help. Her position had been fixed via phonefinder as close to the aircraft crash memorial near the summit of Great Carrs. It was agreed that both teams would despatch parties from their sides. Coniston deployed three members up from Three Shire Stone on Wrynose Pass, and had the shorter walk up, so arrived with the casualty first. She was given warm clothing, escorted down to our vehicle and driven back to her car at the Walna Scar car park.6 volunteer members attended for 4 hours and 10 minutes plus the 6 members deployed by DFMRT.",Great Carrs,NA,3,NA,NA,8,NY270008
"Another pleasant evening for a callout. Cumbria Police called us about a walker who had not returned to his party’s car at Tilberthwaite. This is a contender for our shortest ever callout, because the walker was located and we were stood down after exactly 5 minutes. It does not win, though, as Incident 4 earlier this year was even shorter at 3 minutes. However the Team Leader remained on standby until she received confirmation that the missing walker had returned safely to the car park, approx. 40 mins later.8 volunteer team members attended for 5 minutes, and the TL for 45 minutes. Since we didn’t even get a Land Rover out of the garage, here is one on an earlier incident.",Tilberthwaite,NA,29,NA,NA,7,NY306010

We sent four teams up the likely descent paths given the little information available, but one team obtained a positive contact report from some helpful walkers on the fell – thank you! That report, and the elapsed time, allowed us to focus the search on a more definitive area, including the local car park where she was subsequently found safe and well, trying to make contact on a borrowed phone.10 volunteer team members attended for around 2 hours.",Coniston Fells,NA,27,NA,NA,7,SD271994

We located them using a phone-finder system and found that they were cragfast a short way up The Bell, which is a grade 1 scramble up a rock ridge. One of the two was escorted down and the other required a safety rope, which we set up using our new CMC clutch as a belay device. Fortuitously, we had practised exactly this on the previous evening at almost the same spot, but this was our first rescue using it – it worked well.8 volunteer team members attended for just over 1.5 hours.",The Bell,NA,20,NA,NA,7,SD288977

The walker was contacted by the Team Leader and he said he had found a path but didn’t know where he was. He had passed a waterfall and the reservoir, which he believed to be Levers Water, and was now on a ridge. He was told to stay where he was until we could locate him via the SARLOC System.The link positioned the gentleman at the top of the Old Man. After speaking to him again, he advised us that had met up with some other walkers who had indicated the path down towards Low Water. We gave him further directions and then asked him to contact us once he was at Low Water.After a while and since we were unable to make further contact, a vehicle left the Base with a few members to go and hopefully rendezvous with him. Following information from more walkers, a second Land Rover was sent to check the man’s car and then continue up Coppermines Valley to see if we could meet him. He was located not far from his car, safe and well, as was the dog. He hadn’t been able to communicate with us as he had no charge left on his mobile.

A gentleman who was walking up Coppermines Valley went to her aid but unfortunately he also fell part of the way down. However they were both communicating well with the informant and did not appear seriously hurt.Three vehicles were deployed. Once we had located the casualties who were indeed next to the beck, members went down from the opposite side where there was safer access. They were escorted out of the gorge as they were both on their feet and needed to get warm. The two casualties were fully assessed and wounds treated before they were taken back to the Base.Once at the Base, they were given warm drinks and reassessed.

She was lowered to the bottom of the quarry and reunited with her owner.Marnie was only three years old and her zest for the outdoors filled her short life with fun and joy. The Team sends her owner and family their warm wishes and condolences.We shall however monitor the sheep at the top of the quarry for a few days – they frequently self-rescue, or are easier to catch and rescue when food runs out and they weaken.After two incidents in two days (and three in six months) where dogs have fallen into quarries, dog owners are respectfully asked to take extra care when in the vicinity of quarries, especially if there are sheep around.
