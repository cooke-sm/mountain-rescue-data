Having spent many hours trying to find their way, one of the walkers had also slipped and tripped multiple times and had sustained several injuries. The team were called and due to low numbers from pre-arranged training courses, we requested additional support from Duddon And Furness MRT. The casualties were located and initially provided with a team shelter, additional clothing, food and drink. As expected one of the casualties was injured, in significant pain and was not able to safely walk off the fell. As such evacuation help was provided by Rescue 936 from Caernarfon. Strong pain relief was provided before the casualty was handed over and winched into the helicopter for transfer to hospital. We wish her a quick recovery.

As the Team Leader was gathering information and preparing to call the team out, a passing Mountain Leader stopped to assist. He provided shelter, assessed the situation, and provided an update back to base. It was agreed that the walker was able to walk off the hill under supervision from the ML, with the team ready to respond if needed. Fortunately this was not required and the team stood down when the party arrived at Wasdale Head. Many thanks to the ML who stepped up and provided much needed assistance and reassurance very quickly. See a map of all incidents Incident started at 14:18 and ended at 18:41 making 4.4 hrs in total.

28 in 2023,Full Callout — Overdue,Pillar,"Dry, Sunny","Cockermouth MRT, Cumbria Police",NA,"A call was received yesterday from Cumbria Police regarding a lone walker who had departed with the intention of walking from Wasdale Head to Pillar. A family member had reported him as overdue and was concerned for his safety. The car parks (and pub!) at Wasdale Head were checked, which confirmed that he was likely to be still on the fell. When he still had not turned up in the valley some time later the Team Leader called out the team to make the most of the remaining daylight. A call was also made to Cockermouth MRT to help as Pillar summit represents the border of our respective areas, with quicker access via Ennerdale. Happily, as the first team vehicle was heading into Wasdale the missing walker’s car was observed heading out. He had also just notified the police of his safe return having seen the request to do so on his windscreen. A good outcome. Many thanks to Cockermouth MRT for their quick response. Incident started at 15:44 and ended at 18:34 making 2.8 hrs in total. There were 11 Wasdale team members involved. Total rescuer hours: 31",Overdue

A further call had been received from Cumbria Police regarding a walker who was reported to be feeling unwell and dizzy after being on the fell for many hours. They were also wet and cold, and unable to make further progress. Members of both teams responded once more and returned to Brackenclose for the ascent, with Duddon and Furness MRT first on the hill. On arrival the Duddon and Furness MRT team members found that many passing walkers had stopped to help the casualty in various ways : food and drink, energy gels, emergency shelter and foil blanket. This no doubt helped the casualty both physically and psychologically and many thanks go to all those who delayed their own journeys to help a fellow walker. The team medics then assessed the casualty but following this had enough concerns to request a quicker evacuation to hospital via helicopter. Once again, the Coastguard team were engaged and this time Rescue 199 from Prestwick was despatched to assist, with the team on scene continuing to provide monitoring and reassurance. With the cloud base lifting nicely, Rescue 199 was able to access the casualty site and then fly the casualty to hospital for further assessment. We hope he recovers quickly and is able to return to the fells soon. Thanks again to Duddon and Furness MRT and the crew of Rescue 199.

26 in 2023,Full Callout — Injured & Medical,Great Gable,"Cool, Mist, Rain","Cumbria Police, Duddon & Furness MRT, Rescue 936 from Caernarfon",Ankle Injury,"In the second deployment of the day, we were called by Cumbria Police about a walker who had slipped close to the summit of Great Gable and sustained a suspected broken ankle. Unable to bear any weight, other walkers had managed to carefully carry her down the fell most of the way to Styhead Tarn. As some members of the team had just returned from the previous callout, and with numbers also a little low for the long and difficult carry down to Wasdale Head, additional assistance was requested from our friends at Duddon and Furness MRT and also a Coastguard helicopter. Both were able to respond quickly. Rescue 936 mobilised from Caernarfon and was first ‘on scene’ however at this point the cloud base was too low to safely extract the casualty directly. However, we were grateful to accept the offer to lift both Wasdale and Duddon team members from Gavel Neese to Styhead Tarn, which enabled us to get help to the casualty much quicker. Once on scene the team medics assessed and splinted the ankle, before the stretcher carry down to Styhead Tarn. Rescue 936 was then able to return to pick up the casualty and take her to hospital with some skilful flying in difficult and variable weather conditions, saving us significant effort. The teams then made their way off the fell, with the intent to go back to their respective bases and replenish vehicles. However, shortly after the vehicles got moving, the next call from Cumbria Police arrived…… See a map of all incidents Incident started at 13:10 and ended at 18:16 making 5.1 hrs in total.

25 in 2023,Limited Callout — Lost,Broad Crag,"Cool, Mist, Rain, Windy",Cumbria Police,NA,"We were called by Cumbria Police about two walkers who had made a navigational error on the descent from Scafell Pike and had ended up on difficult ground to the North of Broad Crag summit. Now finding themselves with steep drops all around, darkness falling and deteriorating weather conditions they wisely called for help. Phonefind was used by the Team Leader to successfully locate the walkers. Fortunately the pair were intending to wild camp lower down, so were well equipped to safely spend the night out. This was decided as the best course of action to minimise risk to the team with a callout requested for an RV at base at 0600 on Saturday. The next morning, a group of four team members were deployed to the walkers’ location, where additional warm clothing and helmets were given. They were then assisted back up the steep ground to the summit of Broad Crag, from where a standard walk-off could take place. The walkers were escorted to Wasdale Head Inn, from where they were looking forward to a warmup, food and drink and and then a long and expensive taxi journey back to their car. The team members made their way back to base to replenish the vehicle and enjoy tea and pizza. However, just as the cuppas were being finished, the pager sounded for the next job…….

They were exhausted, becoming increasingly cold and one had a hand injury from a fall. A limited callout was quickly initiated to help. Whilst en-route further information was received that one of the walkers was becoming more seriously affected by the cold, and so air support with winching capability was requested from the Coastguard. Rescue 936 from Caernarfon was tasked. Once on scene a medical assessment was performed before assisting with the winch into the helicopter. The casualty was flown to safety and then transferred to land ambulance for onward transfer to hospital.

The weather remained wet and very misty, making searching in bad ground very challenging and negating the use of helicopter support. He was eventually found at around 14.30hrs as teams were making their way off the hill, on the East bank of Piers Gill. He was hypothermic, with knee, leg and foot injuries, but thankfully alive. Teams brought a stretcher and necessary equipment up to the scene, and after treatment he was stretchered off the hill and taken to hospital. We rarely comment on a rescue, but in this case, we would like to say he was very, very fortunate to have survived his ordeal. We also have to say that Google maps on smart phones are not suitable for navigating on the hills, they lack detail and of course will not work with a flat battery. There is no substitute for a map and compass and being able to use them. They can save one’s life. There were over 70 rescuers from 9 teams involved along with search dogs and team drones. The team wishes to thank the incredible support provided from all the teams that were involved from across Cumbria and from adjacent regions. Also the willingness of both the Helimed and Coastguard helicopter to respond, but prevented by the bad weather. Incident started at 06:03 and ended at 14:47 making 8.7 hrs in total.

17 in 2023,Alert — Overdue,Pillar,"Mist, Rain","Cockermouth MRT, Cumbria Police",NA,"As incident 16 was ongoing with the initial search for a missing walker, another call arrived from Cumbria Police about two walkers who were overdue after a walk up Pillar. As any search for this was more likely to be in Ennerdale, and also due to the ongoing callout in progress near Broad Crag summit, Cockermouth MRT kindly agreed to take over ownership. Happily the missing walkers were located quickly in the Ennerdale valley. Many thanks to Cockermouth MRT for their help. Incident started at 23:24 and ended at 00:20 making 0.9 hrs in total.

Mobile phone reception was very poor, but a location was quickly established and although the weather was deteriorating with thick mist and rain, he was asked to stay where he was and shelter from the wind. Under these conditions, a “talk-off” with rapidly declining phone battery and areas of known no signal at all would have meant the Team Leader losing contact with him, and an impossibly large area to search in very dangerous ground. The team responded quickly as we were already at the rescue base for a training night. Two fast team members, travelling very light with immediate first aid, warm clothing and a shelter were dispatched as there was concern that the casualty would already be very hypothermic. Back up parties followed with additional equipment. The lost walker was not found at the original location, and contact had been lost so a search of the area was mounted in exceptionally difficult conditions. As we had expected to find him at the original location, many of the team members were carrying heavy loads, including stretcher halves. Also an Autopulse which is a life saving mechanical device for carrying out prolonged CPR in the event of a cardiac arrest resulting from severe hypothermia. Keswick Mountain Rescue Team and Cockermouth search dogs were requested and they approached the search area from the North. By the early hours of the morning he had still not been found and teams reluctantly came off the hill having done all they could overnight in extremely cold and wet conditions. The search continued as callout 18 Incident started at 18:31 and ended at 14:47 making 20.3 hrs in total. There were 37 Wasdale team members involved and the incident occured at NY223078.

As the first incident was under control by this point, team members were diverted from Brackenclose to Gavel Neese to support. However, a short time later a further call was received from the casualty party saying that MR support was not needed and they would manage to make their own way off the fell.

13 in 2023,Full Callout — Lost,Scafell Pike,"Drizzle, Hill Fog","Cumbria Police, Duddon & Furness MRT",NA,"The team was called by Cumbria Police about two walkers who had lost the path on the summit plateau and became disoriented in the mist and rain. They were wet and extremely cold due to the significant wind chill and damp conditions and also had minor injuries from some slips and trips trying to find the path. The Team Leader made a full callout, as in the worst case at least one stretcher carry was needed. In addition a ‘talk and walk-off’ was not possible due to a poor mobile signal. Additional resources were once again requested and supplied by Duddon and Furness MRT. An advance party arrived on scene with additional warm clothing and encouragement, and fortunately the two walkers were able to recover enough to gingerly start to walk off the hill. This then helped to warm them further and with the assistance and further encouragement from other arriving team members, the two walkers managed to walk off the fell to safety. This good outcome was enabled by their good clothing and particularly their use of survival blankets that they had in their packs. We hope that the walkers recover well. A huge note of thanks once again to Duddon and Furness MRT for their support. https://www.adventuresmart.uk/ #BeAdventureSmart and make a good day better.

Due to the resources already committed, and the potential for a serious injury, further assistance was requested from GNAAS for helicopter support. They duly obliged but unfortunately the ground was too steep to get a landing site close enough to help. The Coastguard helicopter from Caernarfon with winching capability was then dispatched along with extra support from our friends at Duddon and Furness MRT. When team members arrived on scene, the walker was assessed, given pain relief and the injured leg splinted.

They had received a call from the runner who reported that their head torch had malfunctioned and they were left in the dark. As most fell runners do, they intentionally travelled light but did have emergency equipment. Knowing this and with very poor weather conditions at high elevation the risk was considerable if stranded for an extended period of time. Their partner helpfully had access to a tracking app and was able to give a last known location – near Wind Gap on Pillar. With their car parked in Wasdale, the Team Leader requested help from our neighbours, Cockermouth MRT, as given the circumstances they are able to reach Wind Gap more quickly from the Ennerdale side to provide additional warm clothing. A team from Wasdale MRT was tasked from Wasdale Head to meet Cockermouth and cover the scenario that the runner was still moving down into Mosedale. However, as the Wasdale team was leaving Wasdale Head the good news was received that the runner had made contact with their partner and was back in the valley, confirming that they had indeed managed to get down safely on their own.

The alert was raised by another walker who had encountered them on the hill and volunteered to raise the alarm at the nearest farm. A full callout was swiftly made and the team deployed. The weather conditions were far from ideal for helicopters but both Helimed 58 and Rescue 936 from Caernarfon were scrambled.
It was expected that we would find the casualty and his friend reasonably high up at an elevation of approximately 450m towards Beck Head. However, we were somewhat amazed to find them in the valley near the bridge at Gavel Neese, after somehow they had managed to struggle down together.
Team Casualty Carers assessed and treated the casualty prior to the arrival of Rescue 936 helicopter. They were thankfully able to land near the scene and after a short stretcher carry he was airlifted to hospital for further assessment and treatment.
The team then transported the casualtyâ€™s friend to the Wasdale Head Inn, where we were very grateful for the provision of tea and rather excellent soup.
For the second time in less than 24 hours, we thank both of the helicopter agencies, the walker who raised the alarm, the farming community for making the call to us, and in particular the stoic and determined casualty who made a huge difference to the speed and difficulty of the onward journey to hospital.

Unfortunately the nearest place to do that was a few miles away at the nearest farm. Due to the nature of the injuries, the time elapsed, and the potentially difficult extraction, multiple air assets were requested, and both Helimed 58 and Rescue 199 were deployed quickly. The team also responded quickly to Eskdale but were unsurprisingly beaten to the scene by Helimed 58. They had searched the reported location at Cam Spout with nothing seen, but then noticed a walker waving on the path out of the valley about a mile away. Remarkably the injured casualty had self rescued to the valley floor. This allowed Helimed 58 to land on scene and treat the casualty quickly.

Initially, not enough team members were available for a stretcher carry, and the terrain is very difficult in all directions, so a helicopter was requested to assist. The plan was to lift team members with all the heavy carrying equipment up the hill as high as the cloud base would allow, but whilst the helicopter was en route the cloud base dropped at least another 200m. R936 attempted to lift some team members up to Sty Head but the cloud base was too low so they were dropped back to Brackenclose before returning to Caernarfon. The team then set off on foot, together with seven Duddon and Furness team members. Once on scene, the casualty was assessed and was able to set off walking. The team took the long way round via Esk Hause and Sty Head as it was the easiest way off.

Fortuitously the cloud and rain which had been around for most of the day lifted enough to allow the helicopter to fly. The two walkers were winched, but the crew then stated it was too dangerous for the helicopter to lift team members due to the proximity of a buttress, loose ground and wind conditions.

62 in 2020,Limited Callout — Lost,Broad Crag,"Showers, Windy",NA,NA,"The team were alerted by the police to a party of 4 males aged between 27 and 29 who stated they had taken the â€œeasy routeâ€ up Scafell Pike from Wasdale Head, but, having failed to reach the top were now lost in poor visibility (less than 10m). They were cold and wet through despite their waterproof clothing. The initial 999 call to the police gave us a fairly accurate location, which was quickly confirmed by Phonefind as being on the path across Broad Crag. The team leader was able to contact the party by mobile phone and learned they had been joined by some runners doing the Bob Graham round. He managed to speak to one of the runners, who agreed to lead the party to Broad Crag Col and point them in the direction of Lingmell Col and the path back to Wasdale Head. As one of the four was having a panic attack and others were struggling with aching limbs and all lacked confidence in finding the route down, it was decided to do a limited callout for a small party to meet the group and walk them down. Further use of Phonefind traced their progress to Broad Crag Col where they had been left by the runners, but more calls from the team leader were needed to give them the confidence to begin and then continue their descent. Although the team leader was able to speak to the party at several points on the descent, Phonefind was no longer working from Broad Crag Col until another of the parties phones was used putting them on the main path below Lingmell Col. They were met by the team soon after this but it would be a further 3 hours before they arrived back at Wasdale Head. The group of 4 were joined by two more of their party, who had successfully climbed the Pike but got lost on their descent. A big thank you to the runners who selflessly put their challenge behind schedule to help a group in distress. www.adventuresmart.uk Incident started at 17:55 and ended at 01:07 making 7.2 hrs in total.

A coastguard helicopter was en route but was stood down as North West Air Ambulance attended. Members of the public, a family member and the air crew did their utmost to help the gentleman but sadly to no avail and he passed away. The Air Ambulance was then called away to another incident. Wasdale and Duddon & Furness team members made their way up the fell to bring the gentleman back down to Wasdale. A second coastguard helicopter was requested to assist as the carry from that location would have been very long and difficult. They were able to complete the task, with assistance from some team members.
Many thanks to all involved for their help. The team would like to express their condolences to the family.

Based on the seriousness of the location, very cold weather and darkness the team leader immediately asked for coastguard helicopter assistance, Duddon MRT back up as well as mobilising our own team members. 10 Wasdale and Duddon team members were air lifted to Scafell summit plateau to quickly set up a rope system to gain access to the casualty location. All other team members made their way up the mountain as quickly as possible in case the helicopter was diverted to another call. The casualty location was established by the use of a team member as a spotter from below as well as infra red images from the helicopter. A drone was used to confirm the rescue location as well as giving the rescuers much needed lighting. This proved to be a very useful asset. It was confirmed that the stuck party were 3x climbers, their rope had become stuck when attempting to climb Slingsbyâ€™s chimney route. They had made themselves secure to the mountain before our arrival. All three climbers were lowered down the face on three separate occasions, secured to a team member, to an awaiting party of rescuers who warmed them up, fed and hydrated them and then walked them down to safety. 750 metres of rope were used on this rescue. A big thank you to the coastguard helicopter as well as Duddon MRT again.

The gentleman had damaged his knee whilst descending Scafell Pike, although he tried his best to get down the hill under his own steam, the Brown Tongue path just was too much for him. The Team Leader was able to confirm his location via a PhoneFind and then immediately deploy casualty carers to assess his injuries whilst a stretcher party made it way to the location a little later. The gentleman and his son who were on their own three peaks challenge, sensibly spread over the course of the week, returned to their hotel and decided to delay the rest of their challenge until another day.

The young man had reported that he was on difficult wet slippery terrain and was unable to accurately determine his location. Although, the young man was able to make that initial 999 phone call, any further attempts by the Team Leader to contact him was not possible. Due to the him reporting himself as being safe and uninjured the decision was made to wait it out to see if the weather would clear.

52 in 2020,Full Callout — Lost,"Greta Gill, Scafell Pike","Dry, Gales","Duddon & Furness MRT, North West Ambulance Service, Rescue 199 from Prestwick, Rescue 936 from Caernarfon",NA,"The team were called by Cumbria Police to say some walkers on the Sty Head path reported flashing lights to the south of them. While the team leader was trying to contact them, a further call came in from NWAS to say there was a report of a missing walker with possible injuries on the Corridor Route of Scafell Pike, “phonefind” put them at the Greta Gill crossing on the Corridor Route. Despite extensive questioning of the group whose friend was missing, there was confusion over their location as they described descending Mickledore and being in Hollow Stones, then talked about intending to do a scramble on the way down. However, the description of their location tallied with the phonefind, although this is not infallible. The friend had gone ahead around “a blind corner”, they had lost sight of him and could not make contact. Given that this is an accident black spot, it was felt that there was a high probability that the friend had fallen into Greta Gill and sustained serious, maybe fatal injuries. The team were called out, as were Duddon and Furness team – again – as a stretcher carry from this spot is very difficult. A coastguard helicopter with winching capability was also requested, but as ever, the team still has to mobilise as there are no guarantees that the helicopter will not be called away to another incident. This in fact happened whilst they were en route from Prestwick, and another helicopter from Caernoarfon was tasked to assist us. The team met 2 walkers at Burnthwaite, heading for Brackenclose, who described coming down from Hollow Stones, and believing that one of the party they had met on the hill had a leg injury. The team made their way up towards the Corridor Route from Gavel Neese, searching as they went and were joined by the helicopter who started their search of the area. A second Duddon and Furness Team vehicle went to Brackenclose to talk to these two walkers. Eventually it transpired that one of the walkers that the team had met at Burnthwaite was the missing person, who had crossed the “bad step” but could not get back again, so continued and descended to Wasdale via Spouthead Gill. He was uninjured. We don’t know if he attempted to let his friends know he was OK and walking off. The remaining walkers were escorted off the hill via Lingmell Nose, where one of them twisted an ankle, but managed to walk down with difficulty. All teams were then stood down.

50 in 2020,Alert — Lost,"Green Hole, Upper Eskdale","Showers, Windy","Duddon & Furness MRT, Langdale Ambleside MRT",NA,"2 walkers reported themselves lost after descending from Bowfell in the wrong direction. They had intended to head to Langdale.The call initially went to Langdale and Ambleside MRT because of this but was transferred to Wasdale when a “phonefind” confirmed their position.
The Wasdale team leader was able to have one phone conversation with them but reception was abysmal. They were advised to start walking down the valley, keeping the river on their right, as they would have had a very long wait for help if they’d stayed where they were – 2 hours or more – and in deteriorating weather and poorly clad, they would have been at risk of hypothermia. They would have picked up the path within a short distance.
They had a map but no compass, no food and were wearing shorts and raincoats.
Again, as Wasdale team were still dealing with the Kirk Fell incident, Duddon and Furness sent some team members up the two likely descent routes and the party were found well down the path to the foot of Harknott.
They were taken to a local pub to warm up and arrange transport back to Langdale.

As most of the available Wasdale team members were committed to an incident on Kirk Fell, Keswick team undertook to deal with this – many thanks to them – with assistance from Duddon and Furness team and 2 Wasdale team members. It would have been a gruelling stretcher carry back to Borrowdale so the decision was made to bring the casualty down to Wasdale and once the stretcher party were up and over Lingmell Col and on their way to Wasdale, the Keswick team members retraced their steps along the Corridor Route. The remaining Duddon and Furness and Wasdale team members continued down to Wasdale Head with the casualty, who was taken to Wasdale Head Inn to await the arrival of a family member.

The informant, a family member, had been waiting at the Wasdale Head Inn for their arrival and when it became dark; Cumbria Police were called, and an overdue report was made. Supported by Langdale & Ambleside, Keswick and Duddon & Furness MRTs, investigations were made including analysis of mobile phone use, understanding what their intentions were and what type of decisions would most likely have been made based on how their day might have developed.
With very little information to confirm a route and a location to possibly search, and that the overdue party had not called 999 themselves, Team members were sent out in vehicles to search the roads and Pubs between Langdale and Wasdale.

28 in 2020,Limited Callout — Other,"Brown Tongue, Scafell Pike",Fine,"Galemire Veterinary Hospital, West Lakeland Veterinary Group",NA,"At Wasdale Mountain Rescue Team we recognise that our mission â€œTo save life and alleviate distressâ€ extends further than just the visitors and the local community who visit or live within our area of responsibility. Having team members with their own pampered pooches at home and also our very own much adored search dog Jess, we recognise the distress that both an animal can feel and also that of their owners. Therefore, last night when Cumbria Police contacted us about a St. Bernard dog (Daisy) who had collapsed whilst descending from the summit of Scafell Pike and therefore unable to carry on; our members didnâ€™t need to think twice about mobilising and deploying to help retrieve Daisy off Englandâ€™s highest. Displaying signs of pain in her rear legs and refusing to move, Daisyâ€™s owners were able to keep her well hydrated and fed until team members were able to get on scene with a stretcher to help get them moving again quickly as the weather was due to deteriorate later that evening. In advance of getting on location advice had been sought from several local vets regarding pain relief, possible issues specific to that breed of dog and how best to handle them in such stressful situations. On reaching their location, team members carefully introduced themselves to Daisy so as not to cause any additional distress, and with the help of a treat or two members were able to assess her condition and administer analgesia for the pain. A few different tactics needed to be tried until both Daisy and her stretcher bearers were all satisfied and progress down-hill could be made. It had become quickly apparent that Daisyâ€™s cooperation was going to be essential if we were to make progress as Daisy made sure we knew that if she didnâ€™t want to do something, she wasnâ€™t going to do it. However, after a little persuasion and a bit of arranging the stretcher to become dog friendly and of course plenty more treats, the 55kg Daisy very quickly settled down with her chin resting on the head guard, having realised that we were trying to help her. From there on, apart from the odd little adjustment, the evacuation was found to be not that much different to a normal adult evacuation which is of course is the bread and butter of our team, which we have done hundreds of times before. The adorable Daisy who unfortunately had a hard start in life until she was â€œrescuedâ€ by her current owners a few months ago, has since been reported to have had a good nightâ€™s sleep, snoring a little louder than normal, but back to her usual high spirits this morning. She apparently feels a bit guilty and slightly embarrassed about letting down the image of her cousins bouncing across the Alpine snows with barrels of brandy around their necks. Wasdale Mountain Rescue Team would like to thank both West Lakeland Veterinary Group and Galemire Veterinary Hospital who got in touch and gave invaluable advice and support. Finally, a massive whole 55kg thank you to Daisy the St Bernard who was so well behaved throughout the whole rescue, the perfect casualty you could say.

116 in 2015,Callout — ,Cumbria,NA,NA,NA,"Mountain Rescue Teams in Cumbria come together during major incidents to pool their resources. During the county wide flooding in early December the west of the county was fortunately less badly affected and the Wasdale team took on the role of helping to coordinate the response elsewhere as well as providing a â€˜Type Câ€™ team of swiftwater rescue technicians. This article presents an overview of the events between Sat 5th â€“ Sun 7th December. Early on Saturday morning it was apparent that it had rained hard for a long time and was likely to do so for a lot longer. The morning teleconferences started to conclude that a major flood incident was likely and soon tasks were coming in, particularly around Keswick and Kendal. Around lunchtime Keswick were dealing with a large number of jobs and support was sent from Cockermouth, Wasdale and Duddon teams. Kendal also started to get busy and a second Duddon team went over to support there. Langdale â€“Ambleside were tasked to help rescue people from a bus trapped by landslides on the A591. At this point it started to become apparent that the incident would go on for a long time in many different places and if the MR effort was to keep pace further support was needed. Calls went out to the other regions to ask what help they might be able to offer ? Later on Saturday evening Cockermouth started to flood as well and the main street became a river once again. There was now activity in every MR base in Cumbria, except for Patterdale, which was flooded. Despite the west of Cumbria being relatively unaffected there was a 6 strong team in the Wasdale base helping to keep an overview of events elsewhere. Operations continued through the night around the county. On Sunday the focus started to shift to Carlisle. The out of county teams were important to the MR effort in Carlisle as many of the local teams were busy in their own areas. During the Sunday groups from the Peak District, Calder Valley, Ogwen / North Wales, Swaledale, Upper Wharfdale, Kirkby Stephen, Coniston, Penrith and Wasdale teams were all deployed in Carlisle. Bowland Pennine and CRO also supported in the south of the county. Away from Carlisle operations were still ongoing in Cockermouth and Kendal and new fronts started to open up. Penrith had a number of incidents in Eamont Bridge. Kirkby Stephen were called to help with evacuations in Appleby. Patterdale, now displaced from their base, supported this effort and also helped with the rescue of an Ullswater steamer that broke free from its moorings. Duddon team helped to move Kidney Dialysis patients in the south of the county. Operations continued through Sunday night but by now it was apparent that the pace had to slow, not just because the swiftwater teams were tired but it was also becoming difficult to man the various supporting roles in the bases. Into Monday and there was still flooding in Carlisle and the east of the county but the water was starting to go down slowly elsewhere. The effort continued in Carlisle with mainly local teams from Duddon, Penrith and Wasdale along with the second team to come up from Ogwen. It was known earlier in the weekend that things were difficult in Patterdale but the picture that started to emerge through the day was a community without power, water or telephone links and had been cut off for 2 days due to collapse of Pooley Bridge. The Patterdale team started to get back into the village and with their limited communications provide a picture of the conditions down the valley. By the evening the flood waters had receded in most places and it was only in Patterdale that MR operations continued. Incident started at 07:00. There were 23 Wasdale team members involved.","Cumbria Floods, Swift Water"

LEARNING – Both of these incident we have dealt with this evening have been a direct result of groups becoming separated whilst on the hill for varying reasons. It is essential that if you are in a group that you stay together unless the situation dictates that someone must get help. Especially if your equipment is spread across the group. Further to this, the current weather forecast is predicated to get rather cold over the weekend with snow on the hills, winter is still in mountains and you should go prepared with a torch, plenty of warm and waterproof clothing and a map / compass.

63 in 2011,Limited Callout — Lost,"Great Moss, Upper Eskdale",NA,NA,NA,"‘999’ call came in to Cumbria Police from a male walker who was lost in low cloud on descent from Scafell Pike. The man in his 30’s had been with a group of ten who were out on a stag weekend when he was left behind on the summit of the Pike with no equipment, no wet weather gear or suitable footwear for the heavy rain that was forecast for later that day. He made a valiant attempt to get himself off the mountain with no map but ended up on the crags above Great Moss on the Eskdale side. Realising that he was out of his depth he called the police for help. The Team were called and the Team leader made contact with him, asked him to retrace his steps to the summit and see if he could get back down to Wasdale from there. This he did but was happier to make his way back down to where he had been and then drop down into the Great Moss area of upper Eskdale and follow the river out. As his location and intended route was understood a limited callout was made and six team members went to meet up with him. He was eventually located ay around 9.45 p.m. between Scar Lathing and Sampson’s Stones. His walk out to the vehicles at Brotherilkeld was assisted by team torches. He suffered a minor knee complaint (and was very hungry as his last meal had been breakfast earlier that day). He was driven back to the rest of his friends who were staying in accommodation in the Eskdale Valley. The rescued man, although he should never have been put in the position he was in, had done the correct thing in calling out the team. He would have definitely been unable to get off the mountain that night and unsuitably kitted out for the bad weather front coming in. Incident closed at 11.30 p.m. Eight team members involved.

The team leader quizzed them for over an hour on their mobile to establish where they were and understand the clues they were giving as to location. Their descriptions of having seen a white cross made of stones put their route as Scafell and not Scafell Pike. They had done a lot of turning left and right and walking on snowy footprints without a clue what direction they were actually heading in. They had originally come up out of Eskdale on a three day camping expedition. After passing over Scafell it would appear that they may have got all the way down Shamrock / Red Gill area and then gone over to Lingmell. Other descriptions did not help the location however sufficient information was given to give reasonably safe direction for descent. They continued down the mountain with periodic checks by mobile phone.

It soon became obvious that their progress was very slow and they still had to navigate through Hollowstones (very easy to wander off the path in bad weather). One of the Wasdale members decided to wait for them and lead them through to ‘Y’ junction where the path is well defined. Their progress became even slower as one of their group had bad knees and they had climbed Ben Nevis earlier that day.

He had become crag fast in Great Gully in a particularly inaccessible area and local knowledge of this very difficult and unstable ground was essential to reach him. An attempt to reach him by climbing up the gulley was found to be impossible due to the wet, slippery and very unstable nature of the rock. The rescue was therefore moved to an ascent via the ramp and terraces to enter the gulley from above the crag fast walker and descend by abseil to his location. He was found to be uninjured and was lowered down the gully using 200 metres of rope before being taken back to his vehicle at Wasdale Head.The Wasdale Screes are extremely unstable and subject to constant rockfalls.

The cloud was down to 1,000 feet and casualty location was 1,800 feet so helicopter evacuation was not possible.

The Dore Head scree area was checked out and there were no signs of a casualty nor cries for help. The incident was stood down at 7.20 p.m. and recorded as a well intentioned false alarm. It is worth mentioning that a similar type incident was investigated on Scafell a couple of years ago when the team had just completed a rescue in the Hollowstones area.

27 in 2006,Callout — Other,Scafell Pike,NA,NA,NA,"The police paged the team who were already at the Wasdale Head at the fundraising Kern Knotts weekend to rescue a dog who was unable to walk down from Scafell Pike. The dog, a lovely natured 6 and half year old labrador called Prince had badly injured both of his rear paws and could not walk. His owner, who was from the north east, had called the police via her mobile phone. Their car was at Seathwaite in Borrowdale but the quickest way off the mountain was to Brackenclose in Wasdale. Prince was given canine care and his paws bandaged before he was carefully carried down the mountain on a lightweight stretcher. Although a dog, he was a well proportioned heavy boned animal approaching 6 stones in weight. The six team members who had worked hard to come up the mountain in extremely hot and humid conditions would definitely require additional resources to get him off the mountain. A further 5 team members were summoned from the valley bottom to bring up water and food (it was excessively hot and humid and many of the team member were low on energy due to the time of the call – the BBQ was just about to start ( see Kern Knotts Auction) when the call came in – also there were no running streams above Brown Tongue due to the very hot weather).The carry down took significantly longer than it would have with a normal casualty and so, with a lot of patience on the part of team members, Prince was eventually back at Brackenclose by 10.00 p.m. As their car was parked at Seathwaite, Prince would have to endure a further 2 hours in a taxi – its a dogs life………..one positive outcome for the team was some good publicity. Radio Cumbria were running news stories on the rescue on the Monday and hopefully the local papers will pick up on the story See the pictures of the rescue, his bandaged paws by clicking on the photo…. p.s. This was a very first rescues for one of our probationary members who is planning to write a suitable article as a true-life rescue story… there were a lot of doggy jokes on the way down but the best one was when Base asked for an update on the casualty condition and everyone, including Prince’s owner shouted …..RUFF see true-life rescue story here Incident started at 17:21 and ended at 22:00 making 4.7 hrs in total.

26 in 2006,Alert — Injured & Medical,"Brown Tongue, Scafell Pike",NA,NA,NA,A call came in from a team member who was already on the Scafell Pike descent. A male walker was having difficulty with hi knees on the Brown Tongue descent and was very slowly making his way off the mountain. He was within half a mile from Brackenclose. The struggling walker’s group had already called the police on ‘999’ so the team members call was an early heads up.

22 in 2006,Alert — Overdue,Scafell Pike,NA,NA,NA,"Call form the Police regarding a party of 5 males (all in their 20’s) reported long overdue on the 3 peaks. The informant had dropped them in Wasdale and driven round to Langdale to pick them up, leaving them 4 hours to complete their route – Sty Head, Esk Hawse, Summit. Return via Esk Hawse and Rossett Gill. The team leader advised that 4 hours was unrealistic and more time would be needed to complete that round.

21 in 2006,Callout — Injured & Medical,"Corridor Route, Scafell Pike",NA,NA,Head Injury,"Police paged the team to respond to a mobile phone ‘999’ from an informant on the corridor route. A 44 year old male had fallen over a boulder on the summit of Scafell Pike and had been reported as having injuries to his face and a possible limb injury. The mobile phone was called but there was no answer (no signal?). The party had set off for Scafell Pike along the corridor route via Styhead Pass. Not being able to contact the informant, (a number of attempts were made), it was not known at which end of the corridor route the casualty was to be found. Casualty was eventually found near Skew Gill on the Corridor route. Keswick team had been asked to assist but were subsequently stood down when the casualties condition and location was established. The gash to the head had been sustained on Scafell Pike and he had made his way back down with a bandaged head. There were no other injuries. The team doctor checked him over and he was able to make his own way off the fell with the assistance of his group. His support vehicle (he was part of a group doing the 4 x 3,000 peaks) was waiting for him at Seathwaite. The incident was closed at around 3.00 p.m. It was subsequently established that the injured person had not called the team and was unaware that the team were looking for him whilst he made his way down the mountain. It had been a bystander who had decided to call the team but unfortunately not stayed put to receive subsequent calls from the team.It is worth remembering that when a ‘999’ call is made for mountain rescue it is vital that the informant stays in a position where they can be contacted and also gives clear details of exact location, what has happened, when it happened, who is injured and what the injuries are. The team leader will call back to discuss.The following is a message from the casualty to put the record straight on what actually happened that day Richard I would like to update entry of my incident this year :6/23:24/06/06 ( 11:07 hrs ) – Saturday Although I was seen by the doctor on the mountain and allowed to walk to Seathwaite, I did in fact have a fractured Eye orbit, with severed nerves and eventually impaired vision. the gash I also sustained has cleared up to a lovely scar and the vision back to near normal, however the nerves may take up to 2 years and I’m still numb on parts of the left side of the face and gums. The break has healed on its own with no need for surgery that was discussed at length in the days that followed The number you were given by the police was in fact, uselessly, mine. but as I was out of any signal range walking down the corridor route I never got the calls till back in the hospital that night. The subsequent call to chastise me received a few days later left no number and was from an unobptainable number so I could not reply and set the record right. I have just seen the entry on the web page and thought I ought to put the record straight. I was as you say in the report unaware throughout that you were looking for me and had indeed refused help on the way down from other walkers most of which were very keen to get the helicopter out ( i guess out of concern and the spectacle it would have caused) I organise the charity event that i was part of and take H&S very seriously, we have risk assessments of all our events, clear processes and plans for emergencies and injuries and a support team throughout including first aiders and first aid equipment with us on the walks. I got the distinct impression from the comments left on my phone and in this report that i in some wasted your time and was not worthy of your attention on that day. hopefully the injuries that i did sustain will go someway in correcting the view. I am self sufficient by nature and was not keen on making a fuss however although I personally did not call you out I still feel that the those that did, made a good call based on the facts they had before them at the top of Scafell Pike. The final point was that the facts they gave the police were that the number given was mine, they gave the number of those in our party the time we left the summit our direction and route. the police seemed comfortable that this was exactly what you needed to mount the correct level of support at the time.. they also agreed that as it was freezing cold and blowing a gale at the top that if I could walk it would be best to do so. Clearly not interested in entering some great debate on this, merely to set the record straight as I will be up there again next year with a group, yep not put off despite everything!! despite all of this I would like to donate money to the mountain rescue as the role you all perform is tremendous and worthy. Not sure how much would be useful for you so it would be great if you could give me a call to see what we could arrange Could you please let me know how i do this and if you have the time please give me a call on my mobile Incident started at 11:07.",NA
20 in 2006,Callout — Injured & Medical,Scafell Pike,NA,NA,NA,"Call from Workington Police reporting a 44 yr old male with a “serious knee injury” on Scafell Pike. The informant turned out to be marshalling a large group of 3 Peakers at the NT car park, end of the lake. He didn’t know the exact location of the casualty or nature of the injury – couldn’t confirm whether it was from a trauma event or the result of strain from the challenge. There was apparently one other person with the casualty, who was reported to be in severe and constant pain. When the team leader got to the base, the Police called again to update the situation. They had been contacted again by the informant who now said the casualty was being assisted off the fell by other group members and we were no longer required. The cancellation bleep was put out and the informant was contacted by phone.He now said the casualty was just above the bridge (approx. 400m from vehicles). He was asked if the casualty needed medical attention and indeed whether he ever had. The informant said they would assess him when he gotto the vehicles and would take him to hospital themselves if that proved necessary. Mill Forge closed at 12:15 hrs[Comment from Team Leader – Some people did “roll wheels” so this has been given a full incident number – although we wonder how much of a true emergency it had been. From what the informant could tell it was found difficult to determine whether the casualty had indeed suffered a genuine injury (which the team would always respond to) or whether the injury was actually better classified as a knee strain. Either way, as a general point, it helps prioritize the right levels of response and back up required if informants give more detail when requesting MR assistance. e.g. location and injury and what sort of event caused it].Post event note – the walker had a knee injury when he had done Ben Nevis previously that day and this was the other knee which was a coruscate ligament failure- he had to be fireman carried back down so well done to the person who did the carrying but they would probably have been better staying put and getting him down on a stretcher.

Initial information was sparse but we knew that it involved a groin injury that had got worse as the man was attempting to walk up Scafell (doing a three peaks challenge).As other walkers arrived back off the hill, the message became clearer and it was apparent that he was going to need MR assistance and indeed carrying off the hill. Conditions on the mountain were poor, with low cloud, rain and a fresh wind at that level. With little equipment on scene he was already very cold.Contact was established on scene when one of the team’s supporters came across the incident himself.

He’d been up till about 2.45am trying to resolve the case of a missing person on Scafell Pike and was ringing to tell me the outcome. The case involves a man and wife who become separated somewhere on the Pike. He went down to Seathwaite and reported her lost at about 11.30pm but despite several team members trying to make sense of his vague descriptions of where he’d been, they found it very difficult to either a) confirm she was indeed still on the hill or b) by 2.45am, that she would actually be in danger, even if left until first light. Keswick members met groups of walkers leaving Seathwaite at 2:30 hrs on the Monday morning. They were asked to keep an eye out for her and apparently did find her sitting on the Corridor Route above Piers Gill. The Keswick TL had decided not to ring the Wasdale TL that night because as he said, he didn’t have a lot he could tell him. He wasn’t absolutely sure she was on the hill but did suspect she’d be around the top of Piers Gill. He chose to leave the search to other walkers that happened to be departing from Seathwaite early morning. First light was only a few hours off anyway. Therefore, not an incident for us to log but an interesting story. Incident started at 23:30.",NA
21 in 2005,Alert — Overdue,Scafell Pike,NA,NA,NA,"Call from Workington Police regarding a father and son reported long overdue from Scafell Pike. The informant(his wife) was in Milton Keynes but was expecting telephone contact – which would certainly have been normal. They’d been on the summit at about 1.30pm and they should have been heading back to Seathwaite.The wife was very sensible and was happy that contacting MR didn’t necessarily prompt a blue light reaction straight away. She was therefore pleased to discuss potential issues and rationally decide how best to deal with the specific event. We agreed to leave it until after YHA closing time at 11pm, then the WMRT Leader I spoke to the Keswick MRT Leader if a Keswick MR member could check for the car at Seathwaite. They turned up at 11.20pmbefore anyone had actually rolled any wheels, so not getting logged as an incident.We think they’d gone into the wrong valley and had a big day out, having walked back over to Seathwaite. i.e. they’d gone back to the hostel straight from the hill, without stopping in pubs or to get food at that point. Incident started at 22:40.",NA
20 in 2005,Callout — Lost,Wastwater Screes,NA,NA,NA,"Call from Workington Police regarding two people reported to be stuck on the Scree path, informant at the WasdaleYHA Hostel. The Team Leader rang the informant and found that the Hostel Manager had already set off in a Canadian canoe to attempt a pick up in that. Rather than set a full team boat rescue into full swing the Team Leader decided to go to the Wasdale YHA and see what (if any) further action needed to be taken. In the meantime, he also got three other team members manning Mill Forge Base and preparing our boat for action. On arriving at the lake, it became apparent that the Hostel Manager had indeed reached the two stuck walkers and had got them on board his boat. He was paddling back round the lake, keeping very close to the edge all the way round. Conditions were flat calm but with spells of heavy rain. The Team Leader stayed long enough to get details for the Police but Mill Forge was stood down. The two were from the Manchester area. One of them had experienced difficulty with slippery rocks and poor light, whilst the other had stayed with her to keep her company until help arrived. Incident closed at about 11.30pm. Postscript – last year there was an event when two people got picked up by one canoeist, who then capsized half way across the lake. One of the two had a broken leg! The Team Leader had thought at the time that it involved a singlekayak but the YHA Hostel manager told him more about that incident. It seems that someone staying at the hostel had in fact borrowed one of their Canadians. He’d picked up the two walkers but had them sat quiet upright and with a high centre of gravity, making the vessel unstable. When they capsized the Hostel manager had been the one who then went out in another Canadian to get all three out of the water. Incident started at 21:45.",NA

9 in 2005,Callout — Overdue,Scafell,NA,NA,NA,"The Team were called in by Workington Police to search for two missing male walkers in their early twenties who were described as vulnerable. A party of nine had set off from Brotherilkeld with their leader to climb Scafell. After reaching the summit, a navigational error put the group at the top of Broad Stand. The leader had wisely decided not to descend but retrace his steps back up to the summit ridge. Although mid April, the Lake District was experiencing pretty nasty winter conditions and there was fresh, snow on the ground above 2000 foot and cloud down to 1000 feet Once the group were back on the ridge there was a dispute and two of them walked off and left the leader with a dilemma. As a result the team were called in and search parties were sent in from both sides of Scafell. Fortunately, two walkers descending, high on the flank of Scafell on the Wasdale side were seen by one team member, approached and quickly identified as the missing pair. The two walkers were reassured and safely walked back down to the vehicles at Brackenclose and driven back to Gosforth to wait for their colleagues who were descending back to their vehicle in Eskdale. When the Wasdale vehicles arrived back in Gosforth, one of the two missing walkers became very agitated and irrational and decided to head off into the surrounding countryside, quickly followed by a small group of team members. They eventually caught up with the individual and the situation brought under control. In order to bring the situation to a final safe conclusion, Police back up was requested. After a bit of post rescue ‘sorting out’, the incident was closed at around 10.00 pm. There were approximately 20 team members involved in the rescue.

The Wasdale Team grouped at Cockley Beck with the other rescue teams having parked up at the Three Shires Stone (top of Wrynose). LAMRT took the decision to bring the female walker down into Mosedale rather than return to their parked vehicles. Wasdale were tasked to meet up with LAMRT and Kendal MRT to provide fresh legs. LAMRT and other teams had been out the previous night searching for, and eventually recovering the body of a fallen male walker on Red Screes (Kirkstone Pass) so help from Wasdale was appreciated. The male walker and his injured partner, both in their late twenties were taken down to Cockley Beck, the lady by stretcher, and then the lady was transported back to Santon Bridge in the Team’s vehicle where they were both staying in holiday accommodation.

He was on a mobile phone and through a description of his location along with a grid reference, it placed in him the region of Dropping Crag on the northern side of the mountain. He had been stuck there since mid afternoon. Around 18 team members were involved, 10 on the mountain and the remainder in reserve. The Dropping Crag area was thoroughly searched with no find. Broad Crag was then searched which can sometimes be mistaken for Scafell Pike. Further information was sought from the crag fast walker and eventually, by piecing it all together and getting further information from the police regarding two walkers who were watching a man waving for help, the man was found by one of the team members.

52 in 2004,Alert — ,Upper Eskdale,NA,NA,NA,"This story is being reported here, not as an official incident, but to give recognition to those walkers who make their own way off the mountain rather than just call the rescue teams. The team leader and a friend were out for a scramble on Scafell when they came across a 70 year old man on the Foxes Tarn descent route. The man from Lancashire, had been dropped off at Boot, Eskdale by his wife and was heading for the Band on Bowfell to be picked up again at Old Dungeon Gill, Langdale. He had taken a fall but was alright and was slowly making his way down. Noting the lateness of the day, that he was moving slowly and that he did not have a light the Team Leader decided to walk down to Sampson’s Stones with him (Upper Eskdale), lend him a torch and see him safely on his way across to Three Tarns.When the Team Leader got home he called the leader of the Langdale Ambleside team to advise that the guy would be making his way down in the dark but was fine. If there were calls made to the police for whatever reason then at least he would know about the person and intended route. Nothing further happened until early the next morning when the man’s wife phoned the police to say she was worried about him being so overdue. Shortly after the wife’s call to the Police, the man phoned his wife on the mobile to say he was safely on his way down. He eventually got down safely the next day and called the Team leader to thank him for the loan of the torch and to explain the events of the previous day.He had made his way to Green Hole (at the top of Eskdale), worked his way up and into the crags and mist and lost his route. Recognising that he would not get off the mountain that night, he descended to a safe area and phoned his wife to say that he would not be down to meet her that night but not to worry as he was happy to find a place to sleep in the shelter of the rocks. At first light he started back up but was unable to call his wife on the mobile to reassure her due to no signal. She had started to worry about his condition again in the morning when she had not heard from him so called the police. He called her as soon as he got a signal and then made his way down the Band. A story with a happy ending. He was well equipped ( apart from having to borrow a torch from the Wasdale Team Leader) and is a good example of how some walkers are quite hardy when it comes to looking after themselves, even at the grand age of 70!Thanks for the story Julian.

When they got to the benighted couple they were staggered to find that the torch that they had used to attract attention in the valley bottom was of the 99p variety and smaller than a cigarette packet.

Both groups met up with the lost couple at Ross’s camp at roughly the same time. The couple were walked off the fell and driven to their car in Ravenglass. Incident started at 17:03.",NA

The break was a serious dislocated fracture of the tib and fib and required a helicopter evacuation. The cloud was down and so he was stretchered off the ridge down into the Overbeck valley. The Royal Navy Sea King helicopter from HMS Gannet, Prestwick took the stretcher on board and flew him to West Cumberland Hospital. There were around 14 team members involved. Incident started at 11:19. There were 14 Wasdale team members involved.",NA
39 in 2004,Callout — ,Wastwater Screes,NA,NA,NA,"Whitehaven Police paged the team to respond to an incident at Wastwater lake. A diving group had been concerned over the distressed barking of a dog on the far side of the lake. This continued for over half an hour and was then followed by shouts for help. The cries were coming from high up the gulleys directly opposite Cross walls, the road junction at the mid point of the lake. One of the divers, who was an accomplished swimmer, swam across the lake in his dry suit and proceeded to climb the Screes in an effort to locate the source of this distress. He climbed half way up the Screes before disappearing out of sight behind the gulley sides. The police were already on scene when the team arrived.The advance group set off from the Pump house at the west end of the lake whilst the boat team launched the boat and ferried team members and equipment across the lake. The advance group got to the diver after a grueling 45 minute scramble. No other persons or animals located and it was thought that perhaps the person might have climbed out onto the top and then descended by the walkers paths along the ridge top. As descent was not a safe option, the top group along with the diver, climbed to remaining 300 m to the top and carried on searching the various gulley tops. Nothing was seen or heard.The local farmers were contacted and it was confirmed that one of the farmers had in fact been out on the Screes earlier that day and “there were a lot of barking and shouting”. The incident was stood down at around 1700 hrs as a well intentioned false alarm. The diver was taken back by boat to retrace his steps up the Screes and retrieve his flippers and dry suit which were reasonably well hidden on the Screes ( Tim and Ian did try hard to find them but with no luck). The climb by the diver was a remarkable achievement considering the swim across the lake and the 500m ascent of some extremely steep, slippery and loose mountain side. He was dressed in a thermal, quilted jumpsuit with relatively lightweight rubber diving boots and the temperature that afternoon would be up in the 20’s and the Screes were bathed in sunshine.The team practice that evening was postponed so that team members could catch up on things abandoned for the rescue such as lunch and work. Incident started at 13:11 and ended at 17:00 making 3.8 hrs in total.","Boat, False Alarm"

The team leader contacted the informant, who had needed to travel down the valley in order to get a mobile phone signal. The two male walkers, 21 and 20 years old were completing the three peaks challenge and had already climbed Ben Nevis earlier the day before. They set off up Scafell Pike at midnight and by 0700 hrs the person waiting at Wasdale Head became extremely concerned and called the police.Under the circumstances then team leader believed that they probably made a navigational error and dropped down into the wrong valley on the Eskdale side.

At 1033 hrs the two missing persons turned up safe and well at the Eskdale Youth Hostel and the incident was stood down.

The team were dispatched to locate the father and son. Shortly thereafter the father turns up at the vehicle to say that he had eventually caught up with his son on the top of the Pike but when they were coming back down he lost sight of him again at the Stream crossing, bottom of Brown Tongue at around 1700 hrs.

The father and his 17 year old son from London had set off late morning the previous day and their last contact had been at Brandreth (head of Ennerdale valley late afternoon).Wasdale MRT were asked to search the Mosedale valley up the Blacksail pass ( a possible escape route for them).

The team has a rescue boat and so a limited callout was done to bring in the boat squad. Before the vehicle and boat left the rescue base at Gosforth the incident was stood down as a report came in that the casualties were out of the water and had been taken to West Cumberland hospital by ambulance.The following day more information of the incident was received. It involved two women walking the Scree path. One broke or twisted her ankle and the team would normally have been called to assist. Then along comes a passing canoeist – who offered to take the pair of them across the lake. Apparently, he set off with one on the front and one on the back but somewhere in the middle, he capsized, dumping both in the water.An Ambulance was called and got there but by the time the team received the request for assistance the group had managed to get to the lake shore, somewhere near cross walls. The woman with the ankle injury was taken to West Cumberland Hospital in the Ambulance and the wet woman was taken to Wasdale Head (where she was staying anyway). Incident started at 16:04.",NA

They had left Langdale earlier that day to climb Scafell Pike via Angle Tarn and Esk Hause. They were on the summit of the Pike at 1630 hrs and whilst descending became disorientated and lost on steep ground. They were contactable by mobile phone. Conditions that day were extreme with thunder and lightning and heavy rain showers. Cloud level was around Mickledore and they were lost in the cloud which put them high up on the fell above 850m.They were poorly equipped with no real waterproofs and were wet through and cold. The were sheltering under a blue umbrella but under the circumstances it was probably not the best thing to be under during a lightning storm.With limited information we had, the deteriorating conditions and condition of the lost persons, we enrolled the help of the Keswick, Langdale & Ambleside and SARDA Search dogs. Approximately 40 rescuers were involved. The lost walkers were located at around 2100 hrs on Rough Crag, around 200m below the summit of Scafell Pike on the Eskdale side, just above Penn. Visibility was abysmal with heavy downpours. The ground was very steep with loose boulders and scree. They were walked off the mountain after being kitted out with clothing and warmed up in a bivvy tent. We received refreshments in the Wasdale Head Hotel at midnight and they were then transported back to their campsite in Langdale. The Wasdale base was closed down at around 0100 hrs.Without their mobile phone and a good reception from their location on the crag, the alarm would not have been raised and it would have been the following day at the earliest before their shouts for help might have been heard.

Missing persons were two males (one 54 yrs old and the other in his early 30’s). One was reported to be reasonably well equipped and experienced. We believed they did not have torches. Their intended route wasn’t clear – whilst Great Gable and Kirk Fell had been mentioned it turned out they’d been dropped off at the path toward Scafell Pike, raising the possibility that they were intending quite a long round before coming back to Wasdale Head.The two ladies were looked after the Hotel and a number of calls were made, attempting to locate them and discussing potential courses of action. They turned up at the Woolpack Inn in Eskdale just before 2330 hrs, presumably having made a navigational error and descended that way, rather than to Wasdale.

I also think people should be reminded that we voluntarily provide an emergency service. Whilst we will always respond without hesitation, for anyone who is injured or will come to harm if we don’t; a group of five adults who only have to wait two hours until daylight are not at significant risk.

They had a 13 yr old child who had become separated from a large group and found his way back down to the valley bottom on the Ennerdale side. He had fallen on the way down and was tired and wet. He had a chest injury but it was not thought to be significant enough to require medical attention. The child had become separated from a splinter group of one adult and another child who had set off down from Pillar towards Wasdale Head as they were too cold to continue. The remainder of the large group (now 22 number) carried on up Pillar. The Team leader thought it prudent to send a team member up Mosedale to intercept the Adult and child and advise them that their missing 13 year old was safe and well in Ennerdale.After a good deal of co-ordination of messages and location of missing adults, the whole party were re-united at Wasdale Head. The 13 year old child was taken to the Ennerdale Youth Hostel where it would be easier for the group’s minibus to collect him. The incident was closed down at 1700 hrs with all accounted for and the four team members involved returned home. The leaders of the group had not requested assistance therefore, strictly speaking it was not a rescue, however team resources were deployed in the best interests of the 13 year old and to ensure it didn’t develop into a larger scale incident.It is worth noting that Wasdale MRT have experienced similar incidents in the past with large groups of children who have required assistance.

However, by the time the car parks had all been checked, there was already a group of WMRT team members near to Lingmel Col. The group were tasked to walk out, via the Corridor route. On route the team members also spoke to more “3 Peakers” who were descending from the summit and had not heard or seen anything. With nothing found and no reason to continue the search, Mill Forge base at Gosforth was closed at about 0800 hrs. At 1022 hrs the Police confirmed that the two missing men were found safe and well. They had decided to stay in the Lake District another night and hadn’t told the informant who was located in the Liverpool area and had raised the alarm.

9 in 2004,Limited Callout — ,Scafell,NA,NA,NA,"Call received from Workington Police concerning a party of “3 Peakers” who had just come down off Scafell Pike and had heard shouts for help coming from the Rake End area of Scafell. They were all convinced the shouts were human although they hadn’t established any form of communication (no other words used but “help”). The Team Leader carried out a limited group call-out as a full team call-out was not necessary to investigate the shouts in the first instance. There were seven team members involved in the search, covering the whole area from Rake End to Black Crag and Brown Tongue. Conditions for searching were very good and the search groups were below cloud in those areas. Sound was carrying very well amongst the crags but nothing was found or heard. The informants rang later in the day to see how we’d got on and were surprised we’d found nothing. This is not uncommon due to sheep and occasionally a local vixen who is easily mistaken as a cry for help. The incident was closed as a well intentioned false alarm. Incident started at 02:10.",False Alarm
8 in 2004,Alert — Overdue,Unknown Location,NA,NA,NA,"Workington Police put out a pager message regarding an incident. A request had come in from a concerned partner about a male walker from the Midlands who was walking / camping in the Lake District. The team leader took the call and after assessing the circumstances, discussing the details with a team member, decided to stand until the morning. It was a sound decision as the missing person was safe and well in Wales. Although two team members were involved and the police spent time checking car parks, this incident has not been recorded as a formal incident but printed here for information regarding the team’s activities. Incident started at 23:44.",NA
7 in 2004,Callout — Lost,Ill Crag,NA,Keswick MRT,NA,"The Team Leader received a call from the Keswick team to assist in the search for two walkers who had become benighted on the top of Great End and had requested help using their mobile phone. The Keswick team thought they may need to search along the ridge towards Broad Crag so required a radio relay from the head of the Wasdale valley. This would assist when their group reached Styhead and made their way along the Corridor route which would be out of radio range. The Team Leader and one team member took one of the advance vehicles up to the bottom of Gavel Knees (Great Gable) whilst another team member remained at Gosforth manning the base and telephone at Gosforth. The two missing walkers were eventually found safe and well along the ridge towards Ill Crag, near the top of Calf Cove.The Wasdale group relayed the recall message to the Keswick team members on the Wasdale side and then returned to Mill Forge Base at Gosforth. The Wasdale involvement in the incident was completed at 2300 hrs. The two walkers were safely escorted off the fell and down to their transport in the early hours of the morning. Incident started at 21:15 and ended at 23:00 making 1.8 hrs in total.",NA

The alarm was raised by his brother who had left the casualty in order to obtain a mobile phone signal higher up the mountain. He said he was in the area of Little Narrow Cove (south east side of Scafell Pike).A fast advance group set off up towards Great Moss, upper Eskdale from Taw House Farm while a larger back up group set off with the stretcher. When the two walkers were finally located, they were in fact a lot further up the valley than Little Narrow Cove. They were found at the bottom of the gulley which leads up, out of Eskdale’s Great Moss, into Esk Hause (where we had passed 12 hours earlier that day on the way to incident number 8).The casualty was given a full check up before being found to be fit enough to walk off. As the casualty party were heading for Borrowdale, they were escorted up the gulley to Esk Hause where Keswick team were mustered ready to walk them back down to their car in Borrowdale.The brothers had set off that morning to climb Scafell Pike, taken the wrong turn whilst descending and ended up in Great Moss. They had then set off back up to head for Esk Hause once they knew where they were. The cloud base was well down the fells.The incident was closed down around 2230 hrs. It is worth mentioning that the casualty location is probably the furthest point on the team’s patch for a carry down (around 4.5 miles).

5 in 2004,Limited Callout — Cragfast,Wastwater Screes,NA,NA,NA,"The team were called to respond to a mobile phone ‘999’ call from three male walkers who had become cragfast on the Wastwater Screes. From information received, they were initially thought to be located slightly above the lakeside path. A limited callout was put into motion and a group of around ten were mustered. Once the full extent of their situation was established the rescue became a little more involved. The group had set off that morning from the top end of the Lake to walk down the lake and had then decided to scramble up the Screes to the top. They had managed to get themselves a quarter of the way up, then got into the terraces and become cragfast. Their location was directly opposite the road junction.The team’s rescue boat was launched from the roadside of the lake whilst an advance group set off from the pump house at the west end. The three walkers could be seen from the road high up on the Screes. When team members finally got to them they were assisted down after being helmeted, harnessed and roped up.

A male in his mid-twenties had left Wasdale Youth Hostel to walk to Langdale Youth Hostel. He had failed to turn up. His route was not known.Wasdale MRT, Keswick MRT, Langdale & Ambleside MRT and SARDA (Search Dogs) were called out. The missing walker was eventually located high on the crags above Angle Tarn in the area of Hanging Knotts (just below Ore Gap) at 0445 hrs. Initially it was thought he may need to be rescued using ropes so a 120m rope was ferried up the fell. He was carefully assisted out of his precarious position without need for climbing ropes and was walked down the valley to safety on the Langdale side. The various groups on the search were recalled to their respective bases and the incident was closed around 0830 hrs. Incident started at 00:46 and ended at 08:30 making 7.7 hrs in total.",NA

Her location was unkown but the Police were in contact with her by mobile phone. By the time the team had assembled at the base in Gosforth, a call came through to advise that she had been located. This was achieved by the collapsed person describing her surroundings, but particularly by being able to read the number plate on a car parked close by that could be tracked by the police. She was found by the police and is recovering. The incident was closed at 0330 hrs. Incident started at 03:05 and ended at 03:30 making 0.4 hrs in total.",NA

They were lost on the ridge following their return from doing Scafell Pike and just ‘needed some directions’. They had set off that day from Seathwaite. When questioned on the phone it became obvious to the team leader that they probably were not calling from the Scafell Pike area (later that evening, following more questioning, it became more obvious that they were nowhere near Scafell Pike). They were asked to retrace their steps back to Styhead stretcher box (the last real landmark they were sure of). They tried but said they were stuck with steep crags all around. At this point (1850 hrs) the decision was made to call out the Wasdale team (18 members), the Keswick team (18 members), the Langdale & Ambleside team (6 members, the SARDA dog handlers (8 dogs).They were eventually found by Keswick team members on the summit of Allen Crags, to the north east of Esk Hause, and nowhere near Scafell Pike. This was now 2330 hrs and weather conditions were severe with high winds. One team member was blown off his feet whilst tracking using his GPS which was also blown away and smashed.[If lessons are to be learned from such an incident it would be the importance of good navigation skills and knowing when to start using them. Once started, to keep on using the map and compass to verify your location on a regular if not continuous basis]. Incident started at 17:30. There were 18 Wasdale team members involved.",NA

He was found by a passing walker who used his mobile phone to raise the alarm. The injured person who was a local man, had tried text messaging SOS with accurate details of his location to ‘999’ but he was laying in an area of weak signal. The passing walker took his phone to a higher position on the mountain to get the signal and raise the alarm. Interestingly, if you look at the photograph of where the accident happened you will be surprised that there was no signal. The casualty had set off that day to walk Yewbarrow and then on around the tops. When he got to the second summit of Yewbarrow he saw black storm clouds in the distance so wisely retraced his steps back down to the valley. Rather than just return to the car park he decided to drop down to the lower path which runs alongside the beck. He had only descended 10 metres down the wet grassy slopes when he slipped and fractured his leg.The injured leg was immobilized in an inflatable splint and after suitable anesthesia, the casualty was carried down to Overbeck to be taken to West Cumberland Hospital by ambulance. Photos taken on scene give a good appreciation of the numbers of team members required to effect a rescue of this nature, relatively close to the road. The incident was close at around 1730 hrs. The walker had sustained a nasty double fracture of his lower right leg which required steel pinning. When visited in hospital two days later he was comfortable but resigned to a long recovery period. [Interestingly another local walker had fractured her ankle the following day (Sunday) and was rescued by Cockermouth MRT.

21 in 2002,Callout — ,Unknown Location,NA,NA,NA,"Call from the police to rescue a fallen walker on Scafell. The man in his late 50’s had been attempting the 4 x 3000 challenge and rather than take the Lord’s Rake route from Mickledore to the summit of Scafell he joined another two walkers who were ascending via Broad Stand (see accident Black Spot above). He managed to get up the rock step by using a rope that had been placed there for event runners and walkers. He slipped at the top of Mickledore chimney and fell into the gulley and carried on tumble falling 50 metres down the steep gulley, coming to rest just above the chock stone.
He was conscious but had received several injuries to head and lower limbs. Fortunately a group of mountain rescuers from Trough of Bowland and a member of Langdale Ambleside MRT was in the area and made him safe and provided shelter (he was dressed in shorts and trainers). The weather was poor with cloud base at 500 metres and visibility on the crags down to 30 metres. Temperature was 7 degrees centigrade and fortunately the accident site was sheltered from the strengthening winds.
Due to the nature of his injuries, and the time of the call when many team members are difficult to find, an RAF Rescue Helicopter was scrambled from Boulmer in the North East. The helicopter lifted team members as high as it could and returned to Wasdale Head (after refueling at Carlisle), shut down and waited ready to evacuate the casualty.
It was technically a very demanding rescue in an extremely hazardous location with slippery rock and steep slabs. The evacuation route took a number of hours and involved a pendulum’s horizontal stretcher lower followed by vertical stretcher lower over the 10 meter rock wall above Mickledore and down the scree to Hollowstones (around 2 hours lowering using the 200 metre rope). RAF Stafford mountain Rescue Team provided strong support throughout the lower.
Finally the helicopter came in to land on the shoulder of Brown Tongue so the casualty could be airlifted quickly to West Cumberland Hospital. This in itself was a remarkable bit of flying by the helicopter pilot as he slowly worked his way up the fell (through the cloud) at a height of 6 metres to a suitable pick up point. The team were off the hill and back at base by 1930 hrs and then tidied up. resorted all the crag gear, put the ropes up to dry – all ready for the next rescue which we all hoped would not be for some time. Fortunately we did not have to rescue / search for any of the 200 to 300 ‘three peakers’ who we passed in separate groups of 3 to 20 going up Scafell Pike (many in shorts and trainers with no gear), as we came down from our rescue. Many thanks to the RAF for all their help, also to the Trough lads (we have their kit – give me a call 01946 62176)

Postscript – see following extract from an email sent to the team which gives a little insight into conditions on the tops and it’s impact on the 4 x 3000s…… I was doing the safety sweep from Seathwaite to Steel End (although ended up continuing to Keswick via Helvellyn) for the Ramblers Association event on Saturday. Conditions were pretty bad on the Scafells when we set out from Seathwaite at 9.30 am and quite a few people in the event were unable to locate Lords Rake. When we got to the checkpoint on Scafell it was like a version of the Marie Celeste mystery. There was no event checkpoint (the marshall had been unable to find his way to the summit. Also the marshall for Scafell Pike failed to reach that checkpoint) and the Bowland teams bivvy area contained all their kit including the remains of their breakfast cooking.
We collected all the competitors tags which had been dumped in a heap to pass on to the race organiser. Then we bundled up the kit and weighted it down with more stones. After that we waited for half and hour to see if we had passed any stragglers on the way up, and not seen them in the mist. We had earlier heard the helicopter trying to get in. Four of your team members came by, one of whom was panting pretty impressively, and one who invited us to your evening fund raising party at the Screes. (Sorry we couldn’t make it!) Glad to hear you were able to safely evacuate the casualty after what seems like an epic.

19 in 2001,Callout — Overdue,Upper Eskdale,NA,NA,NA,"Call from Cumbria Police regarding a report of four missing people, believed to have gone onto Scafell Pike. The group consisted of two adults (in their thirties) and two girls (aged 14 and 16). There was little information regarding their experience or the equipment they might be carrying but their wives had given an intended route which would have taken them from Seathwaite, up Scafell Pike and then back to Seatoller via Glaramara and Thornythwaite Fell. The whole group were staying in a guest house in Ambleside. As much of their intended route (including their start and finish) would be within the Keswick MRT area, the team leader passed the details over to the Keswick MRT, Team Leader and the two Team Leaders jointly worked on the incident from there on. Keswick were able to confirm that the missing person’s vehicle was indeed still parked near Seathwaite and they spoke to the wives, to see if they could get any more useful information before we commenced a search for them. Full call outs of Keswick and Wasdale MRTs were initiated at 0120 hrs and the one remaining search dog handler left in the Lake District (while all the rest were away training in Scotland) was also called in to assist. The two teams jointly covered all the major routes around Scafell Pike and the ridge over to Glaramara and eventually located the missing walkers in Eskdale at around 0700 hrs. They had made a navigational error and become lost. They were tired and cold but otherwise unhurt and were therefore assisted to walk off the mountain, before being given a lift back to where they were staying in Ambleside. Conditions on the summits were quite cold and windy and low cloud was causing very poor visibility, particularly during the night. All parties were re-called off the hill and returned to base by around 0930 hrs, 2001-08-21.
Rescue postscript: The team leader subsequently spoke to the deputy team leader, who’s group were the ones that found the four missing walkers. It seems they stayed on their intended route up to the summit of Scafell Pike but that they then went to Mickledore and descended into Upper Eskdale via the side of the Cam Spout waterfall. From there, they attempted to find Esk Hause, to continue over Glaramara but got lost somewhere. We think they spent the night sheltering in a small sheep fold somewhere on the south side of the Esk/Cam Spout area and on the flanks of Esk Pike. They were not very experienced walkers and had not been well equipped to cope with the enforced bivi. It was perhaps fortunate that they found shelter relatively low down and out of the wind as the tops would have been much more unpleasant. The search dog handler from Ambleside gave them all a lift back from Eskdale, in his car. They did not report hearing any shouts or seeing lights of rescuers.

The advance group could see the family stuck on the loose scree, high on the crags above the Burnmmoor Hotel. They had managed to find a secure area in amongst the oak trees but were too scared to come back down. A rope was fixed to the rocks and the young mother and her daughter were carefully led back down the mountain to the father who had raised the alarm. This had started as a fishing expedition due to no access to river fishing due to foot and mouth. They had been told that there was a tarn [Blea Tarn] where they could fish just up from Boot ""…just go over the bridge, past the mill shop and turn left….."". Unfortunately they got themselves lost in the overgrown bracken and then on the craggy area. The couple were not dressed for fell walking as it was a fishing trip (i.e. plastic bag with bait and slip on shoes) – even so they had managed to avoid falling into the many disused mineshafts and adits which litter the face of the fell and were camouflaged with tall bracken. The team brought them safely back down to the valley bottom to re-unite with the husband/ father. Well done to the team member who had the awkward job of route finding, and carrying the fishing rod through the high ferns and gorse.

He had set out the previous afternoon to climb on Buckbarrow. The informant was contacted at their home and more details were gained. The missing climber had left details of exactly which route he was going to climb and we had details of the vehicle he was driving.
The climber was using a rope technique whereby he led, then tied off, descended to untie the lower belay, then work his way back up. With all the information available, the team leader called the full team out at 0100 hrs. Shortly after this, the informant called the team leader to say the missing climber had turned up.

11 in 2001,Limited Callout — Overdue,Scafell Pike,NA,NA,NA,"The team leader received a call from the Wasdale Head Hotel regarding three missing people (doing the three peaks). Originally a group of 7, they had split up having left the summit of Scafell Pike at around 1900 hrs. Four of them had made it back to Brackenclose by 2030 hrs. but three were still overdue. He was advised that they were two men (aged around 30) and one woman (aged around 25) and that they were poorly equipped – shorts, day sacs, no torches, therefore not really up to spending the night out, given the weather – cold, windy and wet weather, with low cloud and poor visibility.
Although the team does not provide a free guiding service, the team leader had the feeling that we would probably have to go for them. He set 2300 hrs. as a further time to review the incident and one of the team members went down to Brackenclose to see if he could spot any sign of them descending Brown Tongue.
The team member rang again, from his mobile phone at Brackenclose at 2315 hrs., to say he had spoken to one and that the other two would be close behind.

They did not have details of the injuries but could me a mobile telephone number for the informant.
The Team Leader rang the informant but had to leave a message (as the number was unavailable – a very common problem!) He did ring Mill Forge as the Team Leader was opening the base and gave details which lead us to request a helicopter. The casualty had in fact fallen from below D Gully Buttress on Pike’s Crag and had fallen around a 30 meters tumble fall, sustaining head, chest, leg and arm injuries. He had been intending to do a rock climb on the crag but had apparently slipped just as he and his companion had reached the base of the crag.

Three of the advance group were lifted and winched onto the scene by Navy Helicopter (but not before the advance had climbed to the top of Brown Tongue). Everybody else had to walk and most didn’t get to the scene before the rescue was completed. The team treated the casualty and got him ready on a stretcher, for winching to the helicopter.

Initially, we could not call them back as their mobile number was unavailable (a common experience). At about 2015 hrs we did talk directly to them and determined that they had been onto Scafell Pike but were now trying to return to Langdale. They described going down onto Great Moss and traversing over to the Green Hole area and Crinkle Crags. From various features, we guessed they were only a few hundred metres south of ‘Three Tarns’. We therefore got them to continue northwards until they could pick up the path again and to descend to Langdale. As no one else was expecting them in Langdale (they were camping for the night) we also rang the team Leader of Langdale / Ambleside MRT to advise him what was going on, giving him details of their vehicle and where it was parked.

They knew the location was at Mickledore ridge, between Scafell and Scafell Pike but phone reception had been cut at that point.

We were able to leave our Base at Gosforth with an advance group of members within 20 minutes of the initial call By then, we also got further information through the Police having managed to re-contact the informant – we now knew that someone had broken both legs and an arm and that he was bleeding. The location given appeared to indicate that this was indeed another Broad Stand incident and the assistance of a helicopter was therefore called for. Twenty members (including two team doctors) of Wasdale Mountain Rescue Team responded to the call. We treated a man (in his thirties and from London) who had indeed fallen around 20m from Broad Stand, Scafell, sustaining severe injuries to his feet and also breaking his right arm. He had been walking alone when the accident happened and had been lying injured for about half an hour before his shouts for help had luckily been heard by other passing walkers. Because of strong winds and difficult flying conditions at the scene, we had to carry the injured man to the nearest point the helicopter could land on. This was about a kilometre away but around 200m up hill ! The helicopter, from RAF Boulmer transferred him to West Cumberland Hospital and the Team returned to base by about 1730 hrs.

3 in 2001,Callout — Injured & Medical,Upper Eskdale,NA,NA,NA,"Call from Whitehaven Police regarding a 57 yr. old man, reported to have chest pains and to be confused. He had been found in the Green Hole area (upper Esk) by a group of walkers. They had taken four hours to get him off the hill and back to the farm at Brotherilkeld, Eskdale but there was concern about whether his wife might also be on the hill. The Team Leader accompanied by another team member responded, immediately taking our AED (Automatic External Defibrillator) up to Eskdale, to (a) offer potentially life saving equipment and (b) to talk to the group of walkers, in the hope of establishing where the casualty had been found and whether his wife might need searching for. We also called one of the team doctors (A&E Consultant and WMRT Deputy Leader) and he attended as well. (A County Ambulance was already on it’s way but due to the remote location at the head of the valley, the Team’s response is quicker). On examining the casualty, it became apparent that his chest pain was more likely to have been caused by impact from a fall. He had bumped his head and had shredded gloves and what was left of broken glasses in his pocket. The most likely explanation for his confused condition was that he had suffered a head injury, resulting from a fall. He was therefore admitted to WCH (and was discharged on the Sunday afternoon). His wife was located at the Stickle Barn, Langdale and no further Team response was required. Incident started at 17:10.",NA

Their car with French number plates was left on the roadside at the cattle grid entry to Wasdale, just before Buckbarrow. The police requested a search of the lower fell area. A limited call out was made and the tracks within Blengdale forest were searched by vehicle. A dog handler searched the upper slopes of Blengdale behind Windsor farm. Footsteps were found in the snow leading towards Haycock. It was a very clear night with temperatures falling to -10 centigrade and a good covering of snow. It was decided to call off the search at 0200hrs. and resume at first light. A second, full call out was made at 0820 the following morning to search Seatallen and Haycock. SARDA lakes were also organised. At 0830 hrs a telephone call (mobile) was received from the (four) missing persons who were camping at Greendale Tarn.

The call had come from another member of the five strong Bradford University group, who had raised the alarm by mobile phone. The casualty was a few hundred feet down from the summit of Scafell, in an area known as Greenhow and their location was in cloud and subject to very strong winds and driving rain. When we found the group, they did have an emergency shelter over the casualty but they were in a vulnerable position, due to the extreme weather. A French girl with the group had also started to suffer from a ""panic attack"". Both her and the original casualty were treated and helped off the hill. 19 members of Wasdale MRT were involved in the rescue, which was closed at around 1900 hrs. A team member transported the group members round to Eskdale Youth Hostel where they were staying. Incident started at 14:45 and ended at 19:00 making 4.3 hrs in total.

44 in 2000,Callout — Lost,Scafell Pike,NA,NA,NA,"Two adult men had rung 999 (from their mobile phone) to report becoming lost while attempting to descend from the summit of Scafell Pike. The team leader rang them back and asked them questions about the features they had passed and determined that they were probably on the footpath, at the top of Piers Gill. At this point, another walker appeared out of the mist and appeared to know where he was. The two men were told to walk back over to Hollowstones and to descend Brown Tongue – the third party was also able to point them in the right direction. Phone reception was not very good, and a number of calls had to be made until the team leader was fully satisfied that no further action was required. Whitehaven Police were informed of the action taken the log closed on the incident about ten minutes after it started. This incident again demonstrates a general trend of how walkers are starting to use mountain rescue teams (and their phones). They are reaching out for assistance at the first sign of trouble, instead of using maps, compasses and common sense to get them off the hill. Incident started at 16:00.",NA
43 in 2000,Callout — Overdue,Scafell,NA,NA,NA,"In the same phone call as above, Whitehaven Police also passed on details of a group of four climbers who were reported to be long overdue, having gone to do a long rock climb on Scafell crag. (Their ages ranged up to 74 yrs and information on medical history gave extra cause for concern.) The full Wasdale Team was immediately called out followed by support from the Millom Fell and Search Team and SARDA Search Dogs. The intention being to deal with the first incident before diverting attention to the second problem. About 18 Wasdale MRT members and 10 Millom FSRT members attended and started carrying out search routes on the mountain. The fell parties were carrying enough equipment to cope with the two casualties when they were found. The Wasdale members took additional ropes and climbing gear for the second incident. This would allow them to deal with the group of missing climbers depending on how the situation developed on the hill. 5 search dogs and handlers joined the search for the injured walkers doing various routes from Wasdale, Eskdale and Keswick. An RAF helicopter was requested due to the potential seriousness of the incidents but due to the severe weather conditions it had to return to base. At about 2300 hrs. assistance was also requested from Keswick MRT, who fielded around 12 more mountain rescue personnel. The two injured walkers were eventually found at around 0130 hrs. but not on the south side of Scafell Pike. They had been totally lost when the incident happened and were found by one of the Keswick search dog handlers relatively low down on the north side of the mountain adjacent to Greta Gill.. Although the information we had received had suggested much worse casualties, both were able to walk, with assistance. They were therefore helped to walk back down to their car on the Borrowdale side. They were checked over and treated by a Doctor from Keswick. One of the casualties was transferred for further checks and treatment at Carlisle Hospital. The group of four missing climbers managed to get themselves to the top of their climb Moss Gill, which finishes almost on the summit of Scafell, and then used their two torches to navigate off the mountain. Although they completed their climb and descent without Team assistance, it took them much longer in the poor weather conditions- heavy rain, thick mist and strong gale force winds. They got back down to Wasdale safely and were fully accounted for and off the hill by around 0145 hrs. A small group of Wasdale MRT members met up with the two casualties and Keswick dog handler and assisted them back to Sty Head, where they were handed over to members of Keswick MRT. The Wasdale members left them there and returned to Wasdale and back to base. All Wasdale MRT were back at base and the incident closed shortly before 0500 hrs. Monday morning.

40 in 2000,Callout — Lost,Scafell,NA,NA,NA,"Call from Whitehaven Police regarding a group (with a mobile phone) who were reporting themselves to be in difficulty and lost on the descent from Scafell. The team leader spoke to the lost party on the mobile and was advised that they were a group of four adults, reasonably well equipped but lost, having been on the summit of Scafell. They had been attempting to descend to Burnmoor Tarn with a final destination of Wasdale Head. They thought they were somewhere on Eskdale Fell. Their Global Satellite Positioning System (GPS) was ""playing up"" (but subsequently turned out to be wrongly pre-set). They were prepared to continue walking if given some guidance. They were asked to walk north until they could find and follow a good feature – Oliver Gill. That should have brought them down to a level where they could see Burnmoor Tarn and find their own way off the mountain. However, 15 minutes later, they rang back to say that their way was barred by a large crag. This information suggested that they were about two kilometres further north than they thought and that they were in fact at the top of Rake End Crags, a different part of Scafell. The team leader suggested they keep moving but in a different direction. However, due to the uncertainty of their navigation, they preferred to sit where they were and wait for the team. Given that there had been very heavy rain and low cloud all day and fresh winds were prevailing, there was no real option but to locate them and escort them off the mountain. Eight team members were sent to find the lost party and bring them safely down to the hospitality of the Wasdale Head Hotel. The group were taken back at the Hotel at around 2230 hrs. to see the personal account of the rescue and picture of the group see ………..

The informant was at Wasdale Head. The man (from the North East) had last been seen near the summit at about 1535 hrs. when he became separated from his colleague. He did not have a map with him and we were given information about his previous medical history which gave us cause for concern. With incident 48 below, we now had two incidents on the go. A full team callout was completed and we used the remaining nine team members and one search dog to start the normal search routes onto Scafell Pike. We received early reports of a single light seen to be descending the fell slowly so we held off bringing further search teams into play until we had confirmation on whether it was our missing person. Unfortunately, at 2130 hrs we got confirmation that it wasn’t. More search dogs were called but at about 2200 hrs. The missing person turned up safe and well, having taken a difficult descent route down the wrong side of Scafell Pike via Cam Spout. He met up with another couple of walkers from Langdale who were also lost and they all walked out via Brotherilkeld, Eskdale.

He was described as being 52 yrs old, healthy and reasonably well equipped and experienced. Having discussed the case with Whitehaven Police and one of the Deputy Team Leaders, we felt it appropriate to wait until first light before starting a search for him.

(postscript – it would have taken the team several hours to have reached them, by which time it was likely that she really would have been very cold and tired, sitting still waiting for us. Even then, unless she had been a real stretcher case, she would still have had to walk down. The team leader got a strong feeling that they really wanted someone to make the decision for them.

When the Team Leader eventually managed to get in touch with them (by mobile phone) they gave me what appeared to be a map reference (from their GPS) but in a format which was new to the team – i.e.: North, 54 degrees, West, 3 degrees etc. They also described where they had left their car and what route they had taken and told me what lakes etc they could see from their location. The team leader believed they were on the side of Yewbarrow and given that there is no easy way off, that doesn’t involve going down craggy ground, he thought it best to ask a small group of team members to go and assist them. He therefore did a committee group alert and 11 members attended (4 on the base/radio relays and 7 on the hill) Fortunately one of the team members managed to interpret their map reference and determined that they might actually be on the side of Lingmel – a different mountain! Further telephone conversations managed to glean enough information to suggest they were on the side of Kirkfell, yet another different mountain !! We finally managed to sight them not far down from the summit of Kirkfell and got to them at about 8.30pm. They were simply frightened to continue without assistance and were on steep loose scree. We put them in helmets and harnesses and assisted them to walk down. Very slow going, with us getting back to Wasdale Head at 10.30pm. The moral of the story : we are seeing an increasing trend that when people use their mobile phones to summon assistance, a lot of them don’t actually know where they are! We can cope better if those people admit to being lost, rather than give us what appears to confident information on their location, only for us to find that they’re on a different mountain. This same situation has occurred several times over the last few months and it potentially makes the time taken to find and help people much longer. Incident started at 18:00.",NA
22 in 2000,Callout — ,Unknown Location,NA,NA,NA,"Call from Whitehaven Police at 11.40 am. They had received a 999 call from someone (with a mobile phone), reporting that a 44 yr old man had collapsed with hypothermia, somewhere between Broad Crag and the summit of Scafell Pike. As the Team was en route to Wasdale, further conversations with the informant advised that the casualty had now become unconscious and that he was very cold. Weather at the scene was cold, windy and extremely wet, and they were in thick cloud. There were a total of seven adults at the casualty site and a further seven members from the group were descending towards Wasdale Head. We found the group near the top of Piers Ghyll and worked on re-warming the casualty for about an hour, before carrying him on a stretcher down to a point on Lingmel Nose, where an RAF helicopter could get in to lift him to safety. He was flown to West Cumberland Hospital, where he made a full recovery. (Although he did make a quick recovery, he had been unresponsive prior to the Team arriving and had got so cold that he’d stopped shivering – i.e.: a sign that his body core temperature was below 30 degrees C. He certainly required assistance !!) As well as being warmed, he was treated with oxygen and his condition was monitored with the Propac. We also had a portable Automatic External Defibrillator with us, just in case he’d gone into Ventricular Fibulation. Due to the high winds, rain and low cloud, the helicopter had some difficulty getting near the casualty’s location (at Piers Gill). They were only able to get in to the pick up point during a break in the clouds and had to get him on board as quickly as possible. One of our team members twisted his ankle on the way down and we did think we might have to also carry him off. However, to all our relief, he managed to walk down under his own steam. Most team members were back at base by around 5.30pm but I think it was about 6.30pm when it was finally closed. also see newspaper article with picture…… Incident started at 11:40.",NA
21 in 2000,Callout — ,Unknown Location,NA,NA,NA,"A 50 yr old man was reported to be suffering a ""panic attack"" and to be stuck in a gully (in thick mist) somewhere on the descent from Great Gable’s summit. ….probably around White Napes. The team leader put out a full team call out and 17 members attended. We were not entirely sure whether they were on the slope above the Beck Head path or on the Napes but found them part way down Arrowhead Gully, Great Napes. We put him in a harness and helmet and belayed him back up the gulley (about 200ft) while we assisted his climbing. We then used tape slings either side of the harness to assist him to walk back down. Back at Mill Forge just in time to see the penalty!! England v Romania 2:3 – European Cup (Probably a mercy that we hadn’t had to watch the whole match) Incident started at 16:40.",NA
20 in 2000,Callout — ,Unknown Location,NA,NA,NA,"Call from Whitehaven Police regarding a man (28 yrs old) who had fallen approx. 15 ft while trying to climb up Hardknott Ghyll (to the right of the road, looking up Hardknott Pass from Eskdale). 20 team members attended and dealt with his injuries before carrying him down the gully bed, to a point where we could then raise him out of the gully and back to the road. (A wet carry through pools and over greasy rocks, with the stretcher being passed between members rather than being able to carry it. Just as well it was a fine, warm day – hottest June day on record in the UK) The casualty was treated for a back injury and possible internal injuries by team members/doctors (including an A&E Consultant, an Anaesthetist and a nurse). The casualty was transferred to West Cumberland Hospital by Ambulance. The rescue was completed and Mill Forge base closed at about 1900 hrs. Incident started at 16:00.",NA
19 in 2000,Callout — ,Unknown Location,NA,NA,NA,"Call from Howard Christie at Wasdale Head, reporting that organisers were worried about four participants in a three peaks challenge event. Three men and one woman, all late twenties / early thirties had left Wasdale Head at 1400 hrs, wearing light clothing. One member in particular was reported to be very experienced but one member of the group had not been feeling well, probably not fully recovered from doing Ben Nevis. They had waterproof clothing with them, torches, map and compass and a rope and even had a radio, although no contact could be made. The Wasdale Team Leader decided to wait until 2300 hrs before asking Search Dogs etc to go and look for them and expected that they had simply made a navigational error, probably going down on the Eskdale side of the fell. (Logic that a group of four could split up if one had suffered incapacity for some reason. Also that hundreds of people were already searching the paths for us – doing the peaks event). MRT’s do not guide people off the hills and only respond if they consider, given the specific facts of each situation, there is a realistic probability that someone is at risk of coming to harm. At 2235 hrs the Wasdale team leader was on the phone to Howard Christie when they turned up. They had indeed made a navigational error and had eventually been assisted onto the correct route down by other 3 peaks participants. Several phone calls were involved, checking Eskdale and speaking on two occasions to the informant resulted in a good hour and half workload for the team. This was therefore logged with Police and listed as an incident (standard rescue team policy to ensure that all incidents are properly recorded for statistics and insurance purposes) Incident started at 21:10.",NA
18 in 2000,Callout — ,Unknown Location,NA,NA,NA,"Call from Whitehaven Police regarding shouts for help and whistles from the Screes. Informant was at the Wasdale Youth Hostel. This report was quickly followed up by further 999 calls from two others with mobiles, who reported they could hear shouts that someone was unconscious, reason unknown. 14 members attended and carried the woman (in her twenties) off the scree path and into the team’s boat. She was transferred across the lake to a waiting ambulance and taken to West Cumberland Hospital. She had suffered a ""funny turn"" and been unconscious/unresponsive for about an hour, although when treated by the team she was conscious although very cold. The lady had experienced similar symptoms before. Members were back at base and Mill Forge closed by around 2000 hrs. Incident started at 17:45.",NA
17 in 2000,Callout — ,Unknown Location,NA,NA,NA,"Call from Howard at Wasdale Head. A woman (approx 35 yrs old) had slipped while descending from Ill Ghyll Head, towards Wasdale Head, National Trust car park at Brackenclose. She had either broken or badly sprained her ankle but had managed to get part way down on her own, until her husband felt it better to get further assistance. 13 members attended and carried her down to a waiting Ambulance, for transfer to West Cumberland Hospital. Her left leg was splinted but no analgesic was necessary. The lady was not far bellow the old huts on the Burnmoor Tarn path when we the team reached her. It wasn’t a long carry and members were back at base by about 1930 hrs. Incident started at 17:50.",NA
16 in 2000,Callout — ,Unknown Location,NA,NA,NA,"all from Whitehaven Police at 09.30 am. Three women (aged between 35 and 45) had used a mobile phone to call 999 for assistance. They reported that they had lost the path in thick mist and were lost, probably somewhere between Broad Crag and Scafell Pike. They were apparently well equipped but were worried about how they would get back to a mini bus (and husband) at the Old Dungeon Ghyll, Langdale. The Police had advised them to stay put until they were contacted by the MRT. Julian Carradice, WMRT Team Leader tried to contact them but could only get an answer phone service (a common problem !!!) Without any further information he told the Police that he would not immediately turn the Team out. He would only initiate a call out if he believed there was a reasonable likelihood that people were at risk. He guessed that they were not far off the path and that once people started to walk along what is a main route to Scafell Pike, they would probably be able to contact somebody who would be in a position to assist them navigate. Julian kept trying to contact them every 10 to 15 minutes and eventually got through at about 10.30 am. During his conversation with them, he got them to get their compass and map out and to tell him in what direction certain features lay, relative to their position. e.g.. they could see Sellafield, they could see a valley to their north (Wasdale) and they could see crags in front of them, to their west (crags above Piers Ghyll/corridor route). Julian told them to walk south east for no more than two hundred meters until they came across the path on Broad Crag. (They had been going from Langdale and were still heading for the summit of the Pike when they got off route) Julian rang them again after 10 to 15 minutes and confirmed that they had regained the path. He then convinced them to head back towards Langdale and that they would warm up as they did this (they had been out since 05.30 am and were very cold and wet.) Julian had further contact with them on two more occasions until he knew they were safely back at Esk Hause. At this point the three ladies were now much happier and knew where they were going. (Last contact with them at 11.30 am). May 2000 Incident started at 09:30.",NA

13 in 2000,Callout — ,Unknown Location,NA,NA,NA,"A group of three team members out for a days walking were planning to check out the ascent / descent routes on Broad Stand, Scafell due to it being one of the Valley’s accident black spots. When they appeared at Mickledore they were approached by a group wanting to borrow a mobile telephone to call out the local mountain rescue team. A man was cragfast below the corner on Broad Stand. Although well equipped and with a rope, he had realised that the route was too dangerous and could not move either up or down. The man was lowered off the crag without further problems. Was this the quickest response to a call-out? On the scene within 3 minutes of the call for help… rescue completed within 20 minutes. See true life rescue story…….. Incident started at 12:45.",NA
